The bromide and the hydroxyl groups are incorporated in the exo-substituents of the nido-boranes. The potential of the bromide σ-hole was compared to that of electrostatic potential of hydroxyl group counterpart. The presence of a carbon atom vertex, in a different position of a system, influences the σ-hole and hence its binding abilities. Bromide substituted nido-carboranes have less potential and hence weaker binding ability compared to their closo-counterparts. Binding affinity with aliphatic is found to be more compared to that of aromatic system. The presence of solvent dampened the electrostatic interactions. Apart from the neutral system, the binding capabilities of charged nido-heteroboranes were also studied. The results of this study will be further useful for several applications viz., crystal engineering, drug designing (Pharmaceuticals), medicine, material science, energy storage devices, etc. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Binding energy; DFT; nido-carboranes; nido-heteroboranes; σ-hole","Boron compounds; Electrostatics; Quantum theory; aromatic compound; borane derivative; boron; bromide; carbon; carborane derivative; hydroxyl group; monomer; solvent; Binding abilities; Binding capability; Carboranes; Computational studies; DFT; Halogen atoms; Hydroxyl groups; Nido-carborane; Nido-heteroborane; Σ-hole; Article; atom; binding affinity; controlled study; crystal; density functional theory; dispersion; electron; energy; medicine; polarization; static electricity; substitution reaction; Binding energy","","","R.

This condition requires improved radiation resistance on detector equipment. The consequent development of new materials, particularly optical materials, becomes crucial. In this work, optical components mean reflectors, light absorbers, or light transmitters. These materials, reflectors or light transmitters, are needed in detectors primarily to collect and transmit light from the scintillator to the PMT. When it comes to light absorbers, they are required to protect the detector from light from the environment. This work aims at studying selected optical materials with improved properties (functional and optical) and radiation resistance that can be used in new detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. Light transmittance, optical reflection, thermal characteristics, and radiation resistance were investigated to evaluate the proposed materials. We have developed optical systems based on siloxanes to continue our previous developments of radiation-resistant materials for radiation detectors. We also report a study of several reflective materials and light absorber introduced into the siloxane. Investigations have shown that these systems are radiation resistant to doses of at least 1 MGy. Tested samples were irradiated at linear electron accelerator LUE-40 in the National Science Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (KIPT). The accelerated electrons were sent to the heavy complex targets to deliver the irradiation with gamma or neutron fluxes. The consequent gamma and neutron fluxes and doses were estimated with the GEANT4 simulation. © 2023 The Authors","HEP; High dose; Irradiation; LHCb; Optical reflection; Optical system; PLUME; Radiation resistance","Neutron irradiation; Optical systems; Silicon compounds; HEP; High dose; LHCb; Light absorbers; New detectors; Optical components; Optical reflection; PLUME; Radiation resistance; Radiation resistant; Reflection","","","A.

Therefore, construction of the Janus surfaces of silk fabrics that possess excellent multifunctionality remains a formidable challenge. Herein, first, silk fabrics were grafted using glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride to form a superhydrophilic surface (G-side). Then, a unilateral hydrophobic surface (O-side) was readily fabricated by mist coating octadecyltrichlorosilane-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) to produce hierarchical surface textures. To prevent NP penetration from the G-side to the O-side, a “fireproof isolation” method was employed. Consequently, Janus silk fabrics (JanSFs) bearing asymmetric wettability were prepared, and their wetting gradient could be conveniently regulated. With the mist time ranging from 4 to 7 min, the unidirectional transport index and efficiency of the unidirectional water transport increased and decreased by 13.2 and 10.4 times, respectively. Sweat could be effectively drained away from human skin to ensure that the skin was dry and comfortable. Compared with the surface temperature of the raw fabric, the raw fabric of JanSFs increased by 2.7 °C. Furthermore, the breathability of JanSF was negligibly affected, and the outer O-side of the JanSF showed substantial antibacterial activity. This study is important for designing JanSFs that exhibit unidirectional water transport. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Antibacterial activity; Janus structure; Misting; Silk fabric; Wet–thermal management","Anti-Infective Agents; Humans; Silicon Dioxide; Silk; Textiles; Water; Chlorine compounds; Fireproofing; Hydrophobicity; Silica nanoparticles; Silk; SiO2 nanoparticles; Wetting; nanoparticle; silk; antiinfective agent; silicon dioxide; silk; water; Anti-bacterial activity; Anti-microbial activity; Fiber diameters; Janus structure; Misting; Multifunctionality; Silk fabrics; Superhydrophilic surface; Water transport; Wet–thermal management; antibacterial activity; antimicrobial activity; aqueous solution; Article; chemical composition; chemical reaction; controlled study; energy consumption; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; hydrostatic pressure; isolation; materials science; pollution; scanning electron microscopy; temperature; ultrasound; water transport; wettability; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; chemistry; human; Textures","","","F.

Notably, the compound formulas of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is effective for chronic liver diseases in clinical trials and basic research in vivo, which provide evidence of chronic liver disease treatment with integrated TCM and traditional Western medicine. Aim of the review: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the compound formulas of TCM for treating different chronic liver diseases to elucidate the composition, main curative effects, and mechanisms of these formulas and research methods. Materials and methods: Different keywords related to chronic liver diseases and keywords related to the compound formulas of TCM were used to search the literature. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched to screen out original articles about the compound formulas of TCM related to the treatment of chronic liver diseases, mainly including clinical trials and basic in vivo research related to Chinese patent drugs, classic prescriptions, proven prescriptions, and hospital preparations. We excluded review articles, meta-analysis articles, in vitro experiments, articles about TCM monomers, articles about single-medicine extracts, and articles with incomplete or uncertain description of prescription composition. Plant names were checked with MPNS (http://mpns.kew.org). Results: In this review, the clinical efficacy and mechanism of compound formulas of TCM were summarized for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, CLD, and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis developed from these diseases and other chronic liver diseases. For each clinical trial and basic research in vivo, this review provides a detailed record of the specific composition of the compound formulas of TCM, type of clinical research, modeling method of animal experiments, grouping methods, medication administration, main efficacy, and mechanisms. Conclusion: The general development process of chronic liver disease can be summarized as chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The compound formulas of TCM have some applications in these stages of chronic liver diseases. Owing to the continuous progress of medical technology, the benefits of the compound formulas of TCM in the treatment of chronic liver diseases are constantly changing and developing. © 2023","Basic research in vivo; Chronic liver disease; Clinical trial; Compound formula of TCM; Efficacy and mechanism; Research scheme","","","","W.

This paper focuses on a specific random variable: the rupture stretch of a material. Examples of statistics include average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and different quantiles. How accurate is the estimate of such a statistic? The answer depends on the statistic, the size of the experimental dataset, and how much the random variable scatters. Here we demonstrate a procedure to generate a large experimental dataset and use the experimental dataset to estimate the accuracy of various statistics of the rupture stretch. We use a high-throughput experiment to measure the rupture stretches of 160 specimens of a silicone rubber. We then use the bootstrap method to determine the 90 % confidence intervals of several statistics. We find that the experimental dataset accurately estimates the average, standard deviation, and 50 % quantile. However, the experimental dataset does not reliably estimate extremely low or high quantiles. This finding indicates an experimental dataset much larger than 160 specimens is needed to accurately estimate rare-event rupture stretch. We further apply the bootstrap method to an experimental dataset of strengths of 33 specimens of a ceramic. The result indicates that this experimental dataset is too small to accurately estimate the average strength of the ceramic. Our findings demonstrate that the common practice of using small datasets to estimate statistics of material properties is outdated and meaningless. The high-throughput experiment provides a large experimental dataset of rupture stretch, from which the bootstrap method quantifies the accuracy of the estimates of various statistics. The bootstrap method does not require the user to have sophisticated expertise in statistical analysis. Nor does the bootstrap method require the dataset to obey any statistical distribution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Bootstrap; High-throughput; Rupture; Statistics","Large dataset; Random variables; Silicones; Bootstrap; Bootstrap method; Coefficients of variations; Deviation coefficient; High throughput experiments; High-throughput; Material science; Rupture; Silicone rubber; Standard deviation; Statistics","","","J.

In recent years, several Latin American countries have sought alternatives to replace fuels with biofuels. In this regard, this article aims to make a bibliographic review focused on the analysis of the current situation of biofuel production and research development in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica and Colombia. For this, seventy-seven investigations extracted in the last ten years from the databases ResearchGate, ScienceDirect, MDPI, Academic Google, Scopus, ScienceDirect, EBSCO and Elsevier were analyzed. Also, and for the same period, a bibliometric analysis of 355 investigations of the Web of Science database was carried out. The article presents the production figures, technologies, advances and challenges for the production of biofuels in these countries. Brazil stands out as a leader in the region and stands out worldwide in the generation of clean energy through the implementation of a biofuels policy and its incorporation into the transport sector. From this review, it is possible to know the state of production and research on biofuels in these countries and the challenges they face in achieving advances that do not reflect the comparative advantages they have due to the availability of raw materials for their production. © 2023 The Authors","Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Biofuels; Biogas; Energy production; First generation biofuel; Renewable energy; Second generation biofuel; Sustainability","Biodiesel; Biogas; Deterioration; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Argentina; Bio-ethanols; Biofuel production; Costa Rica; Energy productions; First generation biofuel; Me-xico; Renewable energies; Second generation; Second generation biofuel; Bioethanol","","","L.P.

Expanded vermiculite (EV), characterized as a lightweight thermal insulator with porous three-dimensional multilayers microstructure, was exfoliated into two-dimensional vermiculite-based nanoplatelets (NV) filler. A scalable ultrasonic exfoliation methodology was proposed for the preparation of the NV filler by adopting ultrasound as the delamination force and water as the liquid phase. NV filler for the first time was introduced into foam concrete as nano-reinforcement. In this study, the ultrasonication times of 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min were studied to determine the optimal delamination effectiveness. The scanning electron images and transmission electron microscopy identified that 60 min sonication effectively produced well-delaminated NV with a smooth surface and reduced wrinkling. The compressive strength, thermal conductivity, infra thermal observation, porosity, and microstructural morphology were systematically investigated on the nanocomposites containing different fractions of NV filler (0.5 % and 1 % under 15min–90min sonication, respectively), EV (10%–20 %) and various NV/EV combined proportions. The nanocomposite containing 1 %/90min of NV fillers exhibited the most significant enhancement in compressive strength by 27.6 %, corresponding to the improved microstructure and porosity. Of all co-existence NV/EV-derived nanocomposites, the sample containing 1 %/60min NV and 50 % EV suggested the lowest thermal conductivity of 0.304 W/(m K). © 2023 The Authors","Energy efficiency; Expanded vermiculite; Foam concrete; Thermal conductivity; Vermiculite nanoplatelet; Water-assisted ultrasonic exfoliation","Compressive strength; Concretes; Exfoliation (materials science); Fillers; Foams; Graphite; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microstructure; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Porosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal conductivity; Expanded vermiculite; Foam concretes; Mechanical performance; Nanoplatelet; Synergistic integration; Thermal Performance; Two-dimensional; Vermiculite nanoplatelet; Water assisted; Water-assisted ultrasonic exfoliation; Energy efficiency","","","Y.

They have been employed in magnetic refrigeration, cancer treatment (hyperthermia), medicine, and magnetic resonance imaging, among other things. Considering the importance of electrically conducting NFs, in this article, we have proposed a fractionalized MHD (Magnetohydrodynamics) and thermal transmission of a Brinkman-type tri-hybrid nanofluid over an infinite plate saturated through a porous medium with generalized velocity and ramped conditions. For the solution of the governed fractional model, we have utilized a recent definition of fractional derivatives, known as Atangana-Baleanu (AB) fractional derivative and Laplace transformation. The computational results are exhibited for tri-hybrid (TiO2-Al2O3-CuO/H2O) NF and described through graphical diagrams and tables to discover the physics of numerous relevant flow parameters on temperature and velocity profiles. It is detected that both thermal transmission and momentum profile for tri-hybrid NF is a better technique as compared to hybrid NF and NF for both graphical and numerical comparisons. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","AB time-fractional derivative; Brinkman type fluid; Heat transfer; Laplace transform; Ramped temperature; Tri-hybrid nanofluid","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Copper oxides; Heat radiation; Hyperthermia therapy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetohydrodynamics; Nanofluidics; Natural convection; Porous materials; Titanium dioxide; Atanganum-baleanu time-fractional derivative; Brinkman type fluid; Computational results; Convective heat transfer; Fractional derivatives; Hybrid nanofluid; Nanofluids; Ramped temperatures; Thermal transmission; Tri-hybrid nanofluid; Laplace transforms","","","A.H.

Building enclosure designers along with the building science community are emphasizing the importance of incorporating air barrier products in the envelope design. Furthermore, regulators are reassessing the allowable air leakage limits prescribed in local codes, to reduce unintentional infiltration. Although voluntary, Passive House building standards inform methods and targets for achieving minimal air leakage values to meet certification. Commercial air barrier products often satisfy the airtightness requirements during and immediately following construction. However, seismic events could potentially damage the air barrier product and compromise the envelope's air tightness. This paper presents the findings of an experimental program conducted to test commercially available air barrier products under in plane cyclic loading. A cyclic loading profile was designed to simulate a seismic event. Selected air barrier products were adhered to small-scale sheathing panels and tested after curing. Multiple combinations of sheathing board material and air barrier tapes were tested. The tested sample groups represent the most common air barrier systems used in the industry, incorporating 3 M Construction Seaming Tape, Siga Wigluv 60, Prosoco R-Guard Joint and Seam Filler, and Zip System Tape. The failure load and failure displacement were recorded for each test, along with the corresponding failure mode. The results of the experimental program suggest that 0.5-inches [1.27 cm] of in plane vertical displacement could completely compromise the air barrier layer due to the delamination or tear of the air barrier sealant. © 2023 The Authors","Air barriers: passive house design; Air tightness; Building; Building envelope; Pressure applied tapes; Science","Architectural design; Construction; Cyclic loads; Energy dissipation; Product design; Software testing; Air barrier: passive house design; Air barriers; Airtight ness; Airtightness; Building envelopes; House design; Passive house; Pressure applied tape; Science; Seismic event; Seismology","","","K.

Aim of the study: To explore the clinical safety and effectiveness of combined application of Shenfu injection in the treatment of septic shock on the basis of routine western medical treatment. Materials and methods: Randomized controlled trials published before February 28, 2022 in patients with septic shock were searched in the Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System (SinoMed), Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, WOS, Scopus. Stata 15.0 and R 4.2.2 were used to meta-analyze sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, case fatality rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial lactate (Lac). Adverse effects were analyzed by description. Results: A total of 904 articles were searched and 56 RCTs were included, with a total of 4279 participants. Among them, there were 2148 cases in the SFI group and 2131 cases in the control group. The meta-analysis showed that, comparing with routine western medical therapy, the combined use of SFI could effectively reduce 24 h SOFA (MD = −0.79, 95%CI: (−1.12) - (−0.46)), 72 h SOFA (MD = −1.53, 95%CI: (−1.89) - (−1.17)) and 7 d SOFA (MD = −1.55; 95%CI: (−2.86) - (−0.24)). Besides, combined use of SFI could reduce 14 d case fatality rate (RR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07–0.37) and 28 d case fatality rate (RR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71–0.95). While SFI group showed almost the same effect in 7 d case fatality rate as control (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.42–1.37; P = 0.37). SFI could increase 6 h MAP (MD = 6.40, 95% CI: 3.43–9.37) and 24 h MAP (MD = 4.79, 95% CI: 1.62–7.95). Additionally, SFI could decrease 6 h Lac (MD = −0.90, 95% CI: (−1.34) - (−0.45)), 24 h Lac (MD = −0.80, 95% CI: (−1.20) - (−0.40)), 48 h Lac (MD = −0.67, 95% CI: (-1.05) - (−0.29)). Conclusions: Shenfu injection combined with RWT showed better therapeutic effect than RWT. SFI plus RWT can improve clinical prognosis of patients with septic shock. © 2023 The Authors","Effectiveness; Meta-analysis; Safety; Septic shock; Shenfu injection (SFI)","Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Lactic Acid; Prognosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Shock, Septic; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone sodium succinate; lactic acid; shenfu; herbaceous agent; lactic acid; shenfu; adult; aged; Article; case fatality rate; clinical outcome; Cochrane Library; controlled study; dizziness; drug effect; Embase; female; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; heart rate; human; kidney dysfunction; lactate blood level; liver dysfunction; male; mean arterial pressure; Medline; meta analysis; middle aged; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; randomized controlled trial (topic); rash; Scopus; septic shock; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; systematic review; Web of Science; western medicine","","","L.

To determine the underlying principles and quantify such behaviour we present a comprehensive computational study addressing the structural, vibrational, electronic and optical behaviour of energetic XeO3 by employing DFT calculations (Density Functional Theory). Our study demonstrates a good agreement between our computed structural parameters at equilibrium and experimental findings, particularly after incorporating vdW (van der Waals) interactions. Also, the mechanical stability of XeO3 is assessed by computing the Cij (elastic constants) and the B (bulk modulus). The evaluation of elastic constants in various directions indicates that (C33 > C22 > C11) XeO3 is highly shock sensitive along crystallographic a-axis. The computed (B) bulk modulus is determined to be 12.98 GPa, aligning closely with the values observed in other primary explosives. The phonon dispersion spectra computed within the harmonic approximation confirms the dynamical stability of XeO3 in P212121 structure. The spectra also reveal a notable interaction between the acoustic and optical branch, resulting in low thermal conductivity which is a trait for the energetic materials. The precise measurement of the energy band gap is crucial for establishing potential correlations with the photodecomposition process of energetic materials. To support this, we have conducted band structure calculations using the TB-mBJ (Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson) potential, alongside the conventional GGA/LDA methods, generally known to underestimate band gaps. Our TB-mBJ based calculations yielded an energy band gap around 2.5 eV, which can also be compared with other energetic compounds. The rapid fluctuations of the optical constants suggest photodecomposition nature of XeO3 in the near UV region. The insights gained from our study would be of high interest for the study of other xenon (Xe) compounds and their oxides, delivering direction for potential applications across diverse fields. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Elastic constants; Electronic structure; Optical properties; Phonons; XeO<sub>3</sub>","","","","G.

When milling Mn0.5Bi0.5 (a fine powder) with carbon, up to 4 wt%, in hexane (or a similar lubricant) in an autoclave, a grafted C-sp2 layer (S2) forms on refined metallic surfaces (S1) in a C-Mn0.5Bi0.5 core-shell.

Moudania, Chalkidiki, Central Macedonia, 63200, Greece","In the current work a setup for the acquisition of high resolution multispectral, spectroscopic mapping infrared images is presented. The idea is based on the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) reflectoscopy since the object is illuminated using the source and the interferometer of an FTIR spectrophotometer and the reflected signal intensity from the object is measured using a high resolution response of a Focal Plane Array (FPA) of InSb sensor. The optical parts like optical fibers, mirrors, beamsplitters, FPA and the FPA lens are selected properly to allow the measurement at a wide frequency range depending on the spectral range of the source interferometer from wavelength 1.3 μm to 26 μm and the spectral range of the FPA which in this case is from wavelength 1.3 μm to 5.5 μm and beyond but with significant attenuation. Moreover, the FPA is triggered through the laser signal that measures the position of the moving mirror of the interferometer and by adjusting appropriately the speed of the scanner mirror and the FPA integration time, the array of interferogramms of a significant region of interest (ROI) can be acquired instantly. This is one of the main contributions of the present work since multispectral images in a non-micrometer level and from an area of a few centimeters by centimeters are acquired by extracting the interferogram, through each sensor of the FPA, in the illuminated ROI and in a time interval less than 1 sec. This is providing to the user the fast acquisition mapping images in a wavelength resolution of the order of less than manometer (based on the spectrophotometers resolution) in a broadband area as stated before. This kind of mapping, multispectral cube images with sub nanometer spectral interval among them, up to now, are acquired by scanning point by point, in an array format, in a ROI of 2 cm by 10 cm, lasting approximately 8.8 hours with 16 averaging per signal. By using this technology in the field of heritage science, the scientists can simultaneously observe, in the case of painted artworks like the ones presented in this manuscript, the overpaintings, pentimenti, defects in the underlayers based on the cube imaging, produced data set, as well as materials identification based on the spectra that are acquired per pixel simultaneously to the cube imaging data set. Using the iTomography system and applying mosaic scanning, the acquisition time of spectroscopic mapping cube images from the hole object, like the icon presented in this work, with dimensions 60 cm × 70 cm, is of the order of 8-10 minutes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Fourier transform infrared multispectral; Hyperspectral spectroscopic mapping imaging","Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Geometry; Hyperspectral imaging; III-V semiconductors; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Indium antimonides; Interferometers; Interferometry; Lenses; Optical fibers; Optical systems; Spectrophotometers; Focal-plane arrays; Fourier transform infrared; Fourier transform infrared multispectral; High resolution; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral spectroscopic mapping imaging; Multi-spectral; Region-of-interest; Regions of interest; Spectroscopic mapping; Antimony compounds","","","G.

Imbalances in polarity within subcellular organelles are closely associated with various diseases. Moreover, volatile organic compounds (VOC) with low polarity pose significant health and safety risks, therefore, researchers have shown great interest in accurately detecting polarity. However, precise observation of polarity changes within organisms and identification of low-polarity volatile organic solvents are formidable challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a versatile polymeric twisting intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect Polysiloxane-n (PDMS-n), utilizing polysiloxane molecular chains as “smart guides” to connect TICT molecules, inspired by the concept of “threading a needle.” With the aid of PDMS-n, the process of polarity changes during cellular lipophagy was monitored in situ with high accuracy. Remarkably, the polarity changes of the local microstructure of the PDMS films were successfully visualized. PDMS-Films were also constructed, which enabled the recognition of Dichloromethane (DCM) gas during swelling. This work will contribute to the understanding of changes in cellular physiological processes, and facilitate the sensitive detection of VOCs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Polarity visualization; Polysiloxanes; Twisting Intramolecular Charge Transfer effect; VOCs","Charge transfer; Dichloromethane; Gas chromatography; Health risks; Microchannels; Polydimethylsiloxane; Swelling; Volatile organic compounds; polysiloxane; volatile organic compound; Cellulars; Complex parameter; Health and safety; Intra-molecular charge transfer; Intramolecular charge transfers; Material science; Polarity change; Polarity visualization; Subcellular organelles; Twisting intramolecular charge transfer effect; biology; health and safety; microstructure; swelling; visualization; volatile organic compound; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell culture; confocal microscopy; cytotoxicity; electron transport; fluorescence intensity; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; lipophagocytosis; molecular probe; MTT assay; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Suzuki reaction; synthesis; twisting intramolecular charge transfer; Silicones","","","M.

In turn, honeycomb layered frameworks manifesting metallophilic bilayer arrangements of cations sandwiched between the transition metal cation slabs have recently garnered attention due to the presence of anomalous fractional valency state of the cations always accompanied by metallophilic interactions constituting the cationic bonds within the bilayered structure. The concepts needed to characterise the aforementioned peculiarities and other phenomena such as conductor-semiconductor–insulator phase transition and magnetoresistance in these materials cut across multi-disciplines ranging from materials science and solid-state chemistry to condensed matter physics, suggesting applications that fall beyond energy storage. This Review highlights the exciting advancements in the science of honeycomb layered frameworks with metallophilic bilayers. First, the latest tactics and techniques including but not limited to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) particularly necessary for characterising recent honeycomb layered frameworks with metallophilic bilayers are described, with emphasis on silver-based oxides. Second, new strategies and concepts related to topochemically- or temperature-induced cationic-deficient phases expanding the compositional space of honeycomb layered frameworks focused on cationic bilayer architectures are also accentuated. Third, the latest condensed matter theoretic advances towards a full, atomistic description of the bilayered structure in such frameworks are detailed, especially related to critical phenomena at the cusp of the monolayer-bilayer phase transition. This entails, in part, describing honeycomb layered frameworks as optimised lattices within the congruent sphere packing problem, equivalent to a particular two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory. Within this picture, the monolayer-bilayer phase transition represents the bifurcation of the honeycomb lattice into its bipartite constituents, related to a 2D-to-3D crossover. Altogether, it is hoped that this Review will give the reader a panoramic view of the honeycomb layered frameworks with important applications within the emerging field of quantum matter, potentially redefining their frontier. Thus, the scope of this Review is expected to be worthwhile for recent graduates and emerging experts alike not only in the materials science and chemistry community but also in other diverse fields of interest. © 2023 The Author(s)","Critical phenomena; Honeycomb layered frameworks; Metallophilic bilayers; Metallophilic interactions; Microscopy; Monolayer-bilayer phase transition; Spectroscopy","High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lattice theory; Monolayers; Perovskite; Physicochemical properties; Positive ions; Topology; Transition metals; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Bi-layer; Bi-layered structure; Cationics; Critical phenomenon; Honeycomb layered framework; Metallophilic; Metallophilic bilayer; Metallophilic interactions; Monolayer-bilayer phase transition; Honeycomb structures","","","G.M.

We used a mixture of Kerosene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for this purpose, examining both single-wall carbon nanotubes and multi-wall carbon nanotubes. The primary equations were converted into a dimensionless form using a similarity transformation technique. To establish a reference dataset for ANN- LMA and to analyze the movement and heat transfer properties of CNTs, we employed a numerical computation method called bvp4c, which is a solver for boundary value problems in ordinary differential equations using finite difference schemes combined with the Lobatto IIIA algorithm in MATLAB mathematical software. The ANN- LMA method was trained, tested and validated using these reference datasets to approximate the solutions of the flow model under different scenarios involving various significant physical parameters. We evaluated the accuracy of the proposed ANN- LMA model by comparing its results with the reference outcomes. We validated the performance of ANN- LMA in solving the Kerosene-based flow with CNTs in a rocket engine through regression analysis, histogram studies, and the calculation of the mean square error. The comprehensive examination of parameters undertaken in this research endeavor is poised to provide invaluable support to aerospace engineers as they endeavor to craft regenerative equipment with optimal efficiency. The pragmatic implications of our study are wide-ranging, encompassing domains as diverse as aerospace technology, materials science, and artificial intelligence.

In this aspect, derivatives phenethylamines, such as 25E-NBOH, have received great attention in the forensic scenario. Hence, we propose portable and cost-effective (U$ 5.00) 3D-printed devices for the electrochemical screening of 25E-NBOH for the first time. The cell and all electrodes were printed using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene filament (insulating material) and conductive filament (graphite embedded in a polylactic acid matrix), respectively, both by the fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing technique. The electrochemical apparatus enables micro-volume analysis (50–2000 μL), especially important for low sample volumes. A mechanistic route for the electrochemical oxidation of 25E-NBOH is proposed based on cyclic voltammetric data, which showed two oxidation processes around +0.75 V and +1.00 V and a redox pair between +0.2 and −0.2 V (vs. graphite ink pseudo-reference). A fast and sensitive square-wave voltammetry method was developed, which exhibited a linear working range from 0.85 to 5.1 μmoL−1, detection limit of 0.2 μmol L−1, and good intra-electrode precision (n = 10, RSD <5.3 %). Inter-electrode measurements (n = 3, RSD <9.8 %) also attested that the electrode production process is reproducible. Interference tests in the presence of other drugs frequently found in blotting paper indicated high selectivity of the electrochemical method for screening of 25E-NBOH. Screening analysis of blotting paper confirmed the presence of 25E-NBOH in the seized samples.

The discovery of new, efficient non-precious metal ORR catalysts is critical for the continued development of cost-effective, high-performance fuel cells. The synthesized carbon material showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the ORR, with half-wave potential (E1/2) and limiting current density (JL) of 0.88 V and 5.10 mA·cm−2 in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. The material has a Tafel slope of (65 mV dec−1), which is close to commercial Pt/C catalysts (60 mV dec−1). Moreover, the prepared materials exhibited excellent performance when assembled as cathodes for zinc-air batteries. The power density reached 110.02 mW cm−2 and the theoretical specific capacity was 801.21 mAh g−1, which was higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst (751.19 mAh g−1). In this study, with the assistance of Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O, we introduce an innovative approach to synthesize advanced carbon materials, achieving precise control over the material's structure and properties.

Heat treatment application is paramount in modulating composite materials' structural and mechanical characteristics, thereby assuming a fundamental role in metal fabrication. The utilization of non-destructive techniques (NDT) has exhibited remarkable potential in elucidating the elemental composition, detecting defects, and evaluating the mechanical properties necessitating novel characterization and assessment methodologies. Nevertheless, the current NDT methodologies exhibit certain constraints when offering a comprehensive analysis encompassing qualitative/chemical composition and quantitative, structural, and mechanical properties assessment. In order to surmount these inherent limitations, the employment of laser-based ultrasonic and optical emission techniques for characterization and analysis has witnessed a notable surge in popularity. This review showcases the viability of employing ultrasonic signal generation and processing mechanisms to assess various material characteristics such as grain size, tensile properties, internal defect detection, and optical emission processing to quantify elemental composition and conduct hardness analysis. Moreover, this comprehensive review introduces a synergistic methodology known as laser opto-ultrasonic dual detection (LOUD), encompassing its automated implementation and characterization prowess. The article also sheds light on the challenges encountered during its application and outlines potential avenues for future advancements. The utilization of LOUD demonstrates its remarkable potential in propelling the field of material research and technology, as it effectively tackles the constraints imposed by current methodologies.

Therefore, when positron annihilation is applied for studying free-volume type defects in such materials, positron trapping at grain boundaries (GBs) cannot be neglected, even when other defect types are in the primary focus. For this purpose, the available diffusion-reaction model for positron trapping and annihilation at GBs is extended to competitive trapping at two different types of intragranular defects. Closed-form expressions for the mean positron lifetime and the relative intensities of the defect-specific positron lifetime components are given. The model is presented for cylindrical-shaped crystallites, but is valid in the general sense for spherical symmetry as well with appropriate replacements. The model yields the basis for properly determining defect concentrations, even for the inconvenient but common case that one intragranular defect type exhibits a lifetime component similar to that in GBs. It turns out, that positron trapping at GBs matters even for µm-sized crystallites and should not be neglected for precise studies of intragranular defects. © 2023 The Author(s).

And Aconitum nagarum Stapf., has recently piqued significant interest among the scientific community given its multifaceted attributes including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, analgesic, and cardio-protective properties. Aim of the study: This review presents a comprehensive exploration of the research advancements regarding the traditional uses, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and toxicity reduction of HA. It aims to provide a thorough understanding of HA's multifaceted properties and its potential applications in various fields. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using several prominent databases including PubMed, Web of Science, NCBI, and CNKI. The search was performed using specific keywords such as “hypaconitine,” “heart failure,” “anti-inflammatory,” “aconite decoction,” “pharmacological,” “pharmacokinetics,” “toxicity,” “detoxification or toxicity reduction,” and “extraction and isolation.” The inclusion of these keywords ensured a comprehensive exploration of relevant studies and enabled the retrieval of valuable information pertaining to the various aspects of HA. Results: Existing research has firmly established that HA possesses a range of pharmacological effects, encompassing anti-cardiac failure, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-tumor properties. The therapeutic potential of HA is promising, with potential applications in heart failure, ulcerative colitis, cancer, and other diseases. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that HA exhibits high absorption rates, broad distribution, and rapid metabolism. However, toxic effects of HA on the nerves, heart, and embryos have also been observed. To mitigate these risks, HA needs attenuation before use, with the most common detoxification methods being processing and combined use with other drugs. Extraction methods for HA most commonly include cold maceration, soxhlet reflux extraction, and ultrasonic-assisted extraction. Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of HA, further research is warranted to elucidate its anti-heart failure effects, particularly in vivo, exploring aspects such as in vivo metabolism, distribution, and metabolites. Additionally, the therapeutic effects of HA monomers on inflammation-induced diseases and tumors should be validated in a more diverse range of experimental models, while the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of HA should be investigated in greater detail. Conclusion: This review serves to emphasize the therapeutic potential of HA and highlights the crucial need to address its toxicity concerns before considering clinical application. Further research is required to comprehensively investigate the pharmacological properties of HA, with particular emphasis on its anti-cardiac failure and anti-inflammatory activities. Such research endeavors have the potential to unveil novel treatment avenues for a broad spectrum of diseases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Aconitum; Content; Detoxification; Diterpenoid alkaloid; Hypaconitine; Pharmacokinetics; Pharmacology; Toxicity","","","","Y.

In the contemporary era, the combination of AM technology and stimuli-responsive hydrogels (SRHs) helps to create dynamic and functional structures with extreme accuracy, which are capable of changing their shape, functional, or mechanical properties in response to environmental cues such as humidity, heat, light, pH, magnetic field, electric field, etc. 3D printing of SRHs permits the creation of on-demand dynamically controllable shapes with excellent control over various properties such as self-repair, self-assembly, multi-functionality, etc. These properties accelerate researchers to think of unthinkable applications. Additively manufactured objects have shown excellent potential in applications like tissue engineering, drug delivery, soft robots, sensors, and other biomedical devices. The current review provides recent progress in the 3D printing of SRHs, with more focus on their 3D printing techniques, stimuli mechanisms, shape-morphing behaviors, and their functional applications. Finally, current trends and future roadmap of additively manufactured smart structures for different applications have also been presented, which will be helpful for future research.

Electro-magnetic levitation (EML) is a prospective method for the growth of high-purity crystals, allowing for avoidance of any contact between the crystal-melt and the crucible. Contactless crystal growth reduces the number of crystal defects commonly abundant in conventional crystal growth methods. The EML method also allows crystal growth of materials with very high melting points. In this article, we report detailed measurements of the EML method. The induction coil used in this study has three turns and one counterturn. We subject different metal material (Al, Cu, Sn, and Ni) samples to the induction coil’s electromagnetic field. For each sample, we measure the induced lift force, Joule heating, and components of magnetic induction as a function of position inside the coil. The results show that the maximum heating in an EML coil is emitted in the area below the levitation zone, a discrepancy not reported earlier. Our findings suggest that this shift should be considered in coil design to avoid instability of the levitated material. We hope this study will serve as a stepping stone for developing EML techniques. The experimental results we provide will be used to evaluate the accuracy of current and future theoretical models of EML coils. This, in turn, will facilitate progress in the application of EML to the growth of larger crystals of higher quality. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, autologous bone transplantation is highly traumatic and bone supply is limited, and allograft bone is rich in sources, but there are serious risks of immune rejection and absorption. In recent years, the tissue engineering technique based on mesenchymal stem cells is a new method for the treatment of femoral head necrosis, which is gradually widely used after basic experiments and clinical application. OBJECTIVE: To review the application and prospect of tissue engineering in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head to provide a new choice for the clinical treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. METHODS: The PubMed database and CNKI database from 2013 to 2023 were searched by the first author with Chinese and English search terms ""tissue engineering, mesenchymal stem cells, biological scaffolds, cytokines, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, bone graft, hip preservation"". The articles on the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head with tissue engineering technology were selected, and 55 representative articles were included for review after the initial screening of all articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) With the continuous development of biotechnology and materials science, great progress has been made in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head by bone tissue engineering, such as the application of gene-modified mesenchymal stem cells to repair osteonecrosis, the combination of gene recombination technology and surface modification technology with bone tissue engineering in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. (2) When applied to the necrotic femoral head, tissue engineering technology can promote the regeneration of necrotic bone tissue and the repair of the vascular system, provide biomechanical stability for the necrotic area, and use bioactive factors to accelerate the repair of seed cells to complete the regeneration of new bone in necrotic area. (3) However, most of these studies are still in the animal experiment stage, and there are still many unsolved problems and challenges in bone tissue engineering research. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, tissue engineering and clinical medicine, biomimetic replacement bone grafting materials with perfect performance are expected to come into being. (4) In the future, bone tissue engineering for osteonecrosis of the femoral head is expected to be a satisfactory treatment for patients with hip preservation. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

These TCMs include monomers isolated from Chinese herbs, extracts of Chinese herbs, and Chinese medical formulae with a lengthy application history. Aim of the study: This review aimed to summarize and analyze the published articles about the NLRP3 inflammasome and its role in the pathogenesis of RA and OA. We also reviewed existing knowledge on the therapeutic mechanism of TCMs in RA and OA via the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Materials and methods: We searched for relevant articles with the keywords “NLRP3 inflammasome”, “traditional Chinese medicine,” “Chinese herbal drugs,” “rheumatoid arthritis,” and “osteoarthritis.” The information retrieval was conducted in medical Chinese and English databases from the date of construction to April 19, 2023, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Database (VIP), and China Online Journals (COJ). Results: According to retrieval results, 35 TCMs have been demonstrated to relieve RA by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, including six traditional Chinese prescriptions, seven extracts of Chinese herbs, and 22 monomers extracted from traditional Chinese herbs and formulae. Additionally, 23 TCMs have shown anti-OA effects with abilities to modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome, including five traditional Chinese prescriptions, one extract of Chinese herbs, and 17 monomers from Chinese herbs. Conclusions: We summarized mechanism research about the pivotal roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of RA and OA. Moreover, a review of TCMs with targets of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RA and OA treatment was also conducted. Our work is conducive to a better application of TCMs in complementary and alternative therapies in RA and OA. © 2023","Anti-inflammation; Chinese herbal drugs; NLRP3 inflammasome; Osteoarthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Traditional Chinese medicine","","","","S.

To address this challenge, a machine learning (ML)-based design approach is proposed herein where ceramic 3D printing techniques are combined to fabricate functionally graded tissue scaffolds composed of Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS), aiming to fulfil the anticipated biomechanical requirements for the target bone regeneration outcomes. The proposed ML based design strategy couples a Bayesian optimisation (BO) algorithm to enable time-dependent mechano-biological optimisation of the 3D printed ceramic scaffolds at a reasonably low computational cost. For a representative example relating to bone scaffolding in a segmental defect of sheep tibia, the simulated results demonstrate that the optimised functionally graded scaffolds significantly enhance bone ingrowth outcomes. Furthermore, a Lithography-based Ceramic Manufacturing (LCM) technique is employed to fabricate the optimised scaffolds based on the proposed ML-based design framework, followed by micro-CT analyses of the additively manufactured ceramic scaffolds to assess their geometric qualities. This study is expected to gain new insights into mechanical sciences on design for varying material conditions and provide an effective design tool for ceramic additive manufacturing. © 2023","Additive manufacturing; Bayesian optimisation; Ceramic; Machine learning; Tissue scaffold","Additives; Bioinformatics; Biomechanics; Computerized tomography; Machine learning; Scaffolds (biology); Tissue; Tissue regeneration; Additive manufacturing technology; Bayesian optimization; Biomechanical properties; Ceramic; Ceramic additives; Ceramic scaffolds; Functionally graded; Machine-learning; Tissue scaffolds; True potentials; 3D printing","","","Q.

The vertical arrangement allows impact into non-cohesive target materials such as sand (representing loose regolith on the surface of solar system bodies) and water. Three key constraints had to be met: (1) the vertical gun had to fit in a laboratory with a ceiling of 3.5 m height, (2) the gun had to operate without a chemical propellant (i.e. gunpowder) and (3) it had to fire into the same target chamber as the existing horizontal Kent gun. In addition, the use of standard pipeline elements was adopted. The result was a self-compressing right angle shaped gun design, with single and two-stage variants for low and high speeds respectively. The gun assembly and its operation are described, together with ancillary components. The self-compressing first stage of the gun (using pressure generated by boiling liquid nitrogen) is horizontal leading into a vertical second stage. The gun has performed as expected, with shots in the speed range 0.3 to 2 km s−1.

Recently, a new 2D boride sheet with ordered metal vacancies and surface terminals (Mo4/3B2−x ) was realized in experiments (Zhou et al 2021 Science 373 801). Here, the 2D monolayer freestanding Mo4/3B2 is evidenced to be thermodynamically stable. Through electronic structure, phonon spectrum and EPC, monolayer Mo4/3B2 is found to be an intrinsic phonon-mediated superconductor. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc ) is determined to be 4.06 K by the McMillian-Allen-Dynes formula. Remarkably, the Tc of monolayer Mo4/3B2 can be increased to 6.78 K with an appropriate biaxial tensile strain (+5%). Moreover, we predict that other transition metal replacing Mo atoms is also stable and retaining the superconductivity. Such as monolayer W4/3B2 is also a superconductor with the Tc of 2.37 K.

Reflection and transmission coefficients are used to study the optical properties of planar geometries. Primary aim of the presented work is to study the reflection and transmission of second harmonic generation in non-integer dimensional environment. Nonlinear medium in our considered geometry is of second harmonic generation type hence we only studied the second order reflection and transmission characteristics. Solution of the nonlinear wave equation is obtained by using slowly varying amplitude approximation and method of separation of variables in NID space is used to study how the presence of NID medium alter the electromagnetic waves. As a special case of the original geometry we also studied the changes in the behavior of the coefficients when an epsilon negative and a mu negative NID mediums are used as a reflected half space. In all the cases impact of the non-linearity and the noninteger dimensions on the unknown coefficients are studied separately. It is studied that higher amplitude of the reflection coefficient can be achieved by using a dielectric magnetic NID medium compared to epsilon negative NID medium. On the other hand it is also noted that for epsilon near zero medium, amplitude of the reflection coefficient reaches zero for specific values of the nonlinear permeability and incident angle whereas, for mu negative NID medium amplitude of both the coefficients increases (decreases) by increasing the values of ϵic(ϵrc). It is also noted that dimensions of the NID mediums can be used as a controlling factor for the amplitude of the coefficients by keeping the same shape. For the verification of the analytical results nonlinear power law is used. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Fractal medium; NID medium; Nonlinear medium; Quasi phase matching approximation; Second harmonic generation","Geometry; Harmonic analysis; Nonlinear equations; Nonlinear optics; Nonlinear systems; Optical properties; Phase matching; Reflection; Transmissions; Epsilon negatives; Fractal media; Mu-negative; NID medium; Nonlinear medium; Nonlinear-medium; Planar interface; Quasi phase matching approximation; Quasi-phase-matching; Reflection and transmission; Harmonic generation","","","A.

OBJECTIVE: Starting from the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines that promote bone formation, to screen cases of their effective combination with different drug-carrying scaffold materials, and summarize the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines that have the potential to be applied to bone tissue engineering. METHODS: CNKI, WanFang, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for relevant literature published from 2000 to 2023, using the keywords of “bone tissue engineering, bone tissue-engineered scaffold materials, bone defect, bone repair, bone regeneration, traditional Chinese medicine” in Chinese and English. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 87 papers were finally included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There are various kinds of active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine to promote bone regeneration, mainly including flavonoids, non-flavonoid polyphenols, alkaloids, glycosides. These active ingredients have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, promote osteoblasts, inhibit osteoclasts and promote early angiogenesis. The combination of active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine with bone tissue engineering is effective in anti-inflammation, accelerating collagen and bone formation, and promoting the expression of osteogenic genes, which provides a theoretical basis for the application of traditional Chinese medicine in bone tissue regeneration, and at the same time provides a new idea for the repair of bone defects. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Requirement prioritization is applied to determine which requirements should be implemented and released. In order to prioritize requirements, there are several approaches/techniques/tools that use different requirements prioritization criteria, which are often identified by gut feeling instead of an in-depth analysis of which criteria are most important to use. Therefore, in this study we investigate which requirements prioritization criteria are most important to use in industry when determining which requirements are implemented and released, and if the importance of the criteria change depending on how far a requirement has reached in the development process. We conducted a quantitative study where quantitative data was collected through a case study of one completed project from one software developing company by extracting 32,139 requirements prioritization decisions based on eight requirements prioritization criteria for 11,110 requirements. The results show that not all requirements prioritization criteria are equally important, and this change depending on how far a requirement has reached in the development process. For example, for requirements prioritization decisions before iteration/sprint planning, having high Business value had an impact on the decisions, but after iteration/sprint planning, having high Business value had no impact.

In many applications the Knudsen regime is predominant, where the pore size is small compared to the mean free path between intermolecular collisions. In this context common parameters to describe the gas percolation through layers of porous media are the probability of gas molecule transmission and the Knudsen diffusion coefficient of the medium. We show how probabilistic considerations on layer partitions lead to the analytical description of the permeability of a porous medium to gas flow as a function of layer thickness. The derivations are made on the preconditions that the molecule reflection at pore surfaces is diffuse and that the pore structure is homogenous on a scale much larger than the pore size. By applying a bi-hemispherical Maxwell distribution, relations between the layer transmission probability, the half-transmission thickness, and the Knudsen diffusion coefficient are obtained. For packings of spheres, expressions of these parameters in terms of porosity and grain size are derived and compared with former standard models. A verification of the derived equations is given by means of numerical simulations, also providing evidence that our analytical model for sphere packing is more accurate than the former classical models. © 2023, The Author(s).","Knudsen diffusion; Monte Carlo simulation; Porous media; Rarified gas flow","Diffusion in gases; Fuel cells; Gases; Intelligent systems; Molecules; Monte Carlo methods; Pore size; Pore structure; Probability distributions; Solvents; Transmissions; Flowthrough; Gas molecules; Knudsen diffusion; Knudsen diffusion coefficients; Monte Carlo's simulation; Porous layers; Porous medium; Rarified gas flow; Technical applications; Transmission probabilities; Flow of gases","","","W.

The presence of at least four elements in equiatomic or near equiatomic composition in HEAs has led to superior properties and vast unexplored alloying space. In this study, we investigated two new HEA powders, AlCoCuMnNi and Al0.25CoCuMnNi, by subjecting mechanically milled (MM) powders to a series of analyses over a 60 h ball milling process. It was found that alloying starts after 20 h of MM and after 45 h, full elemental integration into the host lattice was detected. Meanwhile, further milling to 60 h can cause powder contamination. The High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) results validated the XRD findings and provided further insights into the substantial influence of Al content on the microstructure and the extent of amorphization within the milled powders. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) analysis on the MM powders showed one exothermic peak for AlCoCuMnNi and one for Al0.25CoCuMnNi at high temperatures, which may suggest the formation of the BCC or second FCC phases for these alloys. The results confirmed the significant influence of the increased Al content on increasing both the lattice constant and lattice strain while decreasing thermal stability of the investigated MM powders.

Soils exhibit a complex and diverse composition, characterized by the presence of several phases, including minerals, gasses, organic matter, water, and metals. The study demonstrates the utilization of gamma-ray spectrometry to determine the mass attenuation coefficient and soil bulk density. The impact of incident gamma-ray energy, soil texture, and soil depth on the mass attenuation coefficient is also investigated. The experimental measurements were conducted utilizing a gamma spectrometer equipped with a 2″ × 2″ NaI(Tl) detector at gamma energies of 0.356, 0.662, and 1.332 MeV using 133Ba, 137Cs, and 60Co sources, respectively. The soil samples corresponding to two textures and three depths were collected from the research farms of the Department of Soil Science, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. The study revealed that the attenuation coefficient depends on the energy of incident radiation and the nature as well as the composition of the soil. The mass attenuation coefficient was observed to decrease rapidly with the increase in gamma radiation energy. Mass attenuation coefficient was found to be higher for sandy loam compared to sandy clay loam textured soil. Moreover, the attenuation coefficient was higher for the lower depths than the upper depth. The comparison between the experimental and predicted values of the mass attenuation coefficient, utilizing the XCOM-NIST framework, demonstrated a satisfactory level of concordance within a 10% margin for gamma energies measuring 0.356 and 0.662 MeV. However, the agreement was slightly less favorable, with discrepancies of less than 12% for sandy clay loam samples and less than 15% for sandy loam textured soil samples, when examining a higher gamma energy of 1.332 MeV. The measured value of mass attenuation coefficient was used to calculate soil bulk density, which agreed reasonably well with the values obtained with the conventional method. Specifically, the sandy clay loam samples displayed a range of 7–14% deviation, while the sandy loam textured soil samples exhibited a range of 14–23% deviation. The investigation can be expanded to ascertain significant soil properties, such as porosity and moisture content. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Attenuation; Bulk density; Gamma-ray; Mass attenuation coefficient; Scintillation detector; Soil","Farms; Gamma ray spectrometers; Sodium Iodide; Soil surveys; Spectrometry; Textures; Attenuation; Bulk density; Gamma energy; Gamma-rays; Mass attenuation coefficients; Sandy clay loam; Sandy loams; Soil bulk density; Soil sample; Soil textures; Soils","","","N.

This research introduces a blockchain-based integrated system for managing construction materials and inventory to enhance the traceability and transparency of shared supply chain material information. This initiative will foster a collaborative and open supply chain environment among stakeholders and effectively address material delays, resulting in smoother project operations and minimized disruptions, thus promoting operational efficiency. Furthermore, the system's potential to substantially reduce the incidence of legal disputes is underpinned by the secure and tamper-proof storage of information within shared ledgers, fostering a high level of accountability and trustworthiness. The integration of the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) approach within blockchain smart contracts streamlines procurement processes, leading to a noteworthy reduction in purchase orders and associated overhead costs. The study employs a Design Science Research (DSR) approach to create a decentralised construction supply chain system, monitoring changes in material information during the supply process and addressing uncertainties associated with managing construction material inventory. The proposed system empowers project stakeholders by providing real-time material information access, resulting in improved decision-making and a reduction in material delays. Additionally, the construction material management-based blockchain and smart system enables project parties to efficiently handle inventory for complex projects, interconnecting all supply chain tasks within an integrated smart contract. The usability of the proposed solution was assessed using a usability test technique, with participants confirming its applicability in construction environments. They highlighted key benefits, including reduced material purchasing costs, decreased legal disputes among project stakeholders, and improved decision-making. © 2023","Automated decision making; BIM; Blockchain; Construction cost management; Construction supply chain; Digital construction; Fragmentation","Architectural design; Blockchain; Cost reduction; Information management; Project management; Purchasing; Smart contract; Supply chain management; Automated decision making; BIM; Block-chain; Construction cost managements; Construction supply chain; Decentralised; Digital construction; Fragmentation; Legal disputes; Material information; Decision making","","","F.

Although PiF-IR has primarily been applied to polymer materials, this technology presents significant potential for the chemical characterization of cellular structures approaching single-molecule sensitivity. We applied PiF-IR to differently polymerized F-Actin samples finding general agreement with FTIR spectra from the same samples. Single PiF-IR spectra of F-Actin show variations in the amide I band spectral region, which is related to secondary protein structure. Local variations are also seen in PiF-IR hyperspectra in this region. Such high sensitivity is a necessary requirement for discriminating Actin organization into bundles and other networks in cells and tissue. We applied PiF-IR to mouse liver tissue ex vivo. Single-frequency PiF-IR scans at three different IR frequencies show significant variations in local contrast. However, the presence of other proteins and the unique spatial resolution of PiF-IR pose a challenge to interpreting and validating such data. Careful design of model systems and further theoretical understanding of PiF-IR data far from bulk averages are needed to fully unfold the potential of PiF-IR for high-resolution chemical investigation in the Life Sciences. © 2023 The Author(s)","F-Actin; Infrared spectroscopy; mid-IR photo-induced force microscopy; Nanoscale resolution; Protein folding","Actins; Animals; Mice; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Polymers; Protein Structure, Secondary; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Amides; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Nanotechnology; Proteins; Spectral resolution; actin; polymer; Chemical characterization; F-actin; Force microscopy; Infrared: spectroscopy; Mid-IR photo-induced force microscopy; Midinfrared; Nanoscale resolutions; Photo-induced; Protein foldings; Secondary protein structure; animal; atomic force microscopy; chemistry; infrared spectrophotometry; mouse; protein secondary structure; Tissue","","","D.

Aim of the study: To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of Tanreqing injection (TRQI) with and without Western medicine (WM) for cough caused by acute trachea-bronchitis (ATB). Materials and methods: We systematically searched eight databases, including CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, Science Direct, Wiley, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and WanFang, from inception to August 2023 for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on TRQI for cough caused by ATB. The critical outcomes of interest were time to symptom disappearance, including time for cough symptom to disappear and time to improve cough and sputum production. Important outcomes included symptom disappearance rate, adverse events (AEs) and lung function. We carried out random-effects meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.4 and assessed the certainty of evidence utilizing the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: A total of 2872 citations were identified by our search, of which 26 eligible RCTs enrolled 2731 participants. Low to moderate certainty evidence showed that when compared with WM, TRQI plus WM treatment was associated with a favorable effect on the time for cough symptom to disappear (MD -2.21 d, 95% CI −2.64 to −1.78), time to improve cough and sputum production (MD −0.68 d, 95% CI −0.83 to −0.53), symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.55), forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (MD 0.38 L, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50; MD 2.92%, 95% CI 1.29 to 4.56, respectively). In terms of AEs, there was no association between TRQI plus WM and WM (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.21; low-certainty evidence). Very low certainty evidence showed that TRQI alone was associated with reduced time to improve cough and sputum (MD -0.14 d, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.02) and increased symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.88; low certainty evidence) compared to WM. Conclusions: The overall efficacy of TRQI or WM for ATB cough is better than that of WM, and TRQI also effectively improve symptoms in patients with similar adverse events. However, due to the lack of methodological rigor of included studies, the present findings should be interpreted with caution. We advocate better high-quality and convincing clinical studies to be performed to prove the effectiveness and safety of TRQIs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Acute trachea-bronchitis; Chinese traditional; Cough; Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Tanreqing","ambroxol; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; azithromycin; bromhexine; cefaclor; cefepime; cefoperazone plus sulbactam; cefotaxime; cefoxitin; ceftazidime; ceftriaxone; cefuroxime; levofloxacin; ribavirin; tanreqing; acute disease; adult; aged; clinical outcome; coughing; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; GRADE approach; human; lung function; male; meta analysis; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; sensitivity analysis; sputum; systematic review; tracheobronchitis; very elderly; western medicine; young adult","","","K.

One of the most widely used methods to determine the value of γSV is the Neumann equation of state (EQS), whose application requires the values of the contact angle (θ) and the surface tension of a probe liquid (γLV). Both parameters are determined experimentally, and their values may be subject to considerable uncertainty. In the present work, the uncertainties of the EQS are analyzed by means of the Taylor series method, using a polynomial adjustment to the EQS previously reported. This analysis allowed us to determine the effects of the θ and γLV uncertainties on γSV values. The γSV of polyoxymethylene (POM) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was calculated using the EQS from four probe liquids and taking into account the propagation of the θ and γLV uncertainties. Generally, the comparison of the γSV values calculated from the different probe fluids revealed significant differences. As a solution to this inconsistency in the EQS method, we proposed taking into account a systematic standard uncertainty associated with the method equal to 1.3 mJ/m2. This allowed the differences between the γSV values for the different probe liquids to be non-significant and therefore the method to be consistent. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Contact angle; Experimental uncertainty; Surface free energy; Uncertainty analysis","Contact Angle; Free Energy; Liquids; Measuring Instruments; Polyacetals; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Propagation; Surface Tension; Acetal resins; Equations of state; Free energy; Probes; Uncertainty analysis; Energy determination; Equation-of-state; Experimental uncertainty; Neumann equation; Probe liquid; Surface-free energy; Systematic uncertainties; Uncertainty; Uncertainty calculations; Uncertainty propagation; Contact angle","","","J.M.

The purpose is traceability and accuracy in measurement results. The RMs has been used in numerous fields of science such as chemical industries, metallurgy, food industry, medicine, cryobiology, environmental monitoring etc. In environmental monitoring, use of reference gas mixtures (RGMs) is highly needed for calibration of instrument and detection of complex matrices. RGMs should be simple to prepare, accurate, reproducible and stable over a period of time. Environmental sample have many variabilities such as low and high concentration level of analytes, possibility of interferences, spatial and temporal variability in matrix, so to quantify the sample there is strong need of RGMs. In ambient air, pollutants present in nmol/mol and pmol/mol amount fractions, to overcome the limit of quantification of these pollutants RGMs are perfect solution. This review covers the broad area of techniques related to preparation of RGMs, their advantages and disadvantages. The gas mixture preparation is categorized in three types: static, dynamic and mixed technique. Metrological traceability, specification and quantification of each source of uncertainty related to all methods has been explained. The technique used for preparation for reactive, toxic, malodorous gases is also mentioned in the paper.

Instead, experts rely on physical examination by the pathologist. Due to interpretive concerns regarding Diatom tests, they are often insufficient in establishing a diagnosis, but offer the potential to be an extremely useful diagnostic tool with further understanding. The aim of study is to optimize “Diatom Tests” for use in forensic medicine in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Methods: A randomized prospective experimental study was conducted, using albino Wistar rat models (Rattus norvegicus), at the Veterinary Facility, University of Sarajevo. Thirty-two adult albino rats, were used and distributed into groups as follows: Group A (6 deceased rats with COD other than drowning, but due to mechanical asphyxia, which were then submerged for 1 h after death); Group B (6 deceased rats with COD other than drowning, but due to mechanical asphyxia, which were then submerged for 72 h after death); Group C (6 rats that were immediately autopsied after drowning, with COD determined as drowning); Group D (6 rats that underwent a 48-hour postmortem period after drowning); Group E (COD: drowning, post-mortem 72hrs after death, remained submerged in water until PM). Live algological material was collected for the research of the systematics of algae from the Bosna river, Sarajevo, and transported to the University of Sarajevo (Department of Biology, Faculty of Science). Periphyllon, epiphyllon and epipelon were used to collect phytobenthos. The material was fixed with 4% formalin solution. Laboratory processing of diatoms was performed using the methods described by Hustedt (16). In the process of obtaining pure diatom valves, part of the material is digested with potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and oxalic acid (C2H2O4). In the next step, the cleaned diatom valves were mounted in Canadian balsam. A light microscope under 1000x magnification (Best Scope 2020) was used to evaluate and analyze the species. The identification of diatoms was performed using the reference of Cantonati et al (17). The nomenclature of diatom species was performed according to Guiry & Guiry's worldwide electronic internet database. Results: No diatoms were found in Groups A and B. However, Navicula sp. and Sellaphora sp. cf., were discovered during bone analysis of Group C where rats were immediately autopsied after drowning. Hantzschia amphioxus taxon was present in Group D, which underwent a 48-hour postmortem period after drowning and before samples were taken. In Groups C and D, where drowning was the COD, Diatoma vulgaris i Pinnularia major, Achnanthidium minutissimum i Melosira varians were present in the tooth samples. Conclusion: Optimization of the “Diatom Test” method could potentially lead to its future use as a routine method within experimental settings. This experimental study is a starting point that guides forenscic medicine pracitioners towards the optimization of tests and sampling in cases of unexplained etiology, where preserved soft tissue structures is not available. In these cases, teeth and bones serve as accessible materials for diagnosing COD, alongside standardized nonspecific findings in the absence of organs for micro- and macroanalysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Asphyxia; Bone; Death; Drowning; Forensic; Teeth","balsam; formaldehyde; oxalic acid; permanganate potassium; sulfuric acid; adult; animal experiment; Article; asphyxia; autopsy; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Branchiostoma; controlled study; diagnosis; diagnostic procedure; diatom; drowning; experimental study; microscopy; Navicula; nonhuman; physical examination; rat; Rattus norvegicus; river; soft tissue; taxon; tissue structure; tooth; Wistar rat","","","E.

In recent times, the field of materials science is also undergoing a big data revolution, with large database and repositories appearing everywhere. Traditionally, materials science is a trial-and-error field, in both the computational and experimental departments. With the advent of machine learning-based techniques, there has been a paradigm shift: materials can now be screened quickly using ML models and even generated based on materials with similar properties; ML has also quietly infiltrated many sub-disciplinary under materials science. However, ML remains relatively new to the field and is expanding its wing quickly. There are a plethora of readily-available big data architectures and abundance of ML models and software; The call to integrate all these elements in a comprehensive research procedure is becoming an important direction of material science research. In this review, we attempt to provide an introduction and reference of ML to materials scientists, covering as much as possible the commonly used methods and applications, and discussing the future possibilities.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2023, The Authors.","machine learning; materials science","","","","H.-Q.

However, there are still several problems when reusing software components, such as the management of the dependencies of a project. Modern build systems provide dependency managers to support developers when dealing with dependencies. But even with this tool support, dependency management is an error-prone task which can lead to dependency hell if it gets out of control. In this paper, we propose DVALIDATOR, an approach that considers dependencies on project level and method call level for validating dependencies in build configurations. First, DVALIDATOR encodes a project's dependency graph as specified in a build configuration and its call graph into a representation using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Then it uses Clingo as a solver to detect problems with the dependencies in that build configuration. In a preliminary evaluation with four open source Maven projects we show that our approach can detect selected dependency smells in less than eight seconds. Next steps concern the investigation of our approach for automatically improving dependency configurations, such as automatically repairing dependency smells and conflicts.

In this study, we investigate the impact of palladium (Pd) doping and tensile stress on the electronic, magnetic, and elastic characteristics of SrRuO3 perovskite through density functional theory (DFT) simulations. We begin by confirming the mechanical stability of SrRuO3 perovskite at varying Pd doping concentrations by applying the Born stability criterion. The negative formation energy values reinforce the stability of the material. We also analyze the alterations in elastic parameters at 6%, 12%, and 20% Pd doping ratio and compare these findings with other perovskite materials. Furthermore, we determine the elastic yielding points and discuss the influence of tensile stress on both pristine SrRuO3 and Pd-doped SrRuO3, shedding light on the material's mechanical behavior. Our analysis reveals electronic phase transitions, shifting between metallic and semi-metallic properties, as a function of strain and Pd concentration. Additionally, our calculations demonstrate that the magnetic properties of deformed SrRuO3, whether in its pure form or Pd-doped, can surpass those of unstrained materials. The insights gained from this research offer a comprehensive understanding of how deformation and Pd doping can be employed to tailor the electronic and magnetic characteristics of SrRuO3 perovskite. This knowledge has significant implications for a wide range of applications in the fields of electronics and spintronics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Electronic properties; First-principles calculations; Mechanical properties; Orthorhombic perovskite; Structural properties","Density functional theory; Magnetic properties; Mechanical stability; Palladium; Perovskite; Resistors; Ruthenium compounds; Stability criteria; Strontium; Strontium compounds; Density functional theory simulations; Elastic characteristic; Electronic and magnetic properties; Electronic characteristics; First principle calculations; Magnetic characteristic; Material science; Orthorhombic perovskite; Palladium doping; Strontium ruthenates; Electronic properties","","","L.B.

Constructing suitable, reproducible and infinitely close to clinical animal experimental models and their scientific evaluation are essential for further clinical treatment of related diseases. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the preparation methods and characteristics of common animal models of femoral bone defects and to assess their strengths and weaknesses, thereby providing some reference for relevant researchers to select appropriate animal models of femoral bone defects. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and CNKI were retrieved for relevant literature published from January 1, 2000 to August 1, 2022. The keywords were “bone defect, bone, bones, defect, defects, defective, animal model, animal, model, laboratory, laboratory animal, animal laboratory” in English and “bone defect, animal model, experiment” in Chinese. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Twenty-seven randomized controlled animal experiments involving rats, mice, New Zealand rabbits, and sheep were included, analyzed and assessed. The most common types of bone defects were cylindrical bone defects and segmental osteotomy bone defects, generally found in the middle and distal femur. These models are mostly used to evaluate the effects of bone repair materials, drugs, drug-loaded active substances and physical therapy on bone defect repair and explore defect healing mechanisms, particularly the weight-bearing bone defect repair mechanism. Different defect kinds and femoral bone defect ranges have been found in different animal experiments. Researchers can select the suitable animal model and bone defect type based on the goal of the experiment and then set an acceptable bone defect value. Current studies have shown that cylindrical and segmental osteotomy-induced bone defects, mainly in the distal and middle femur, are mostly used in the animal models of femoral bone defects and that the surgical methods and postoperative management are more mature and operable to provide mature experimental animal models. In terms of cylindrical bone defects, rats and New Zealand rabbits are more suitable, whereas segmental osteotomy has no special requirements and all types of animals can meet the experimental requirements. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Characterizing the roughness, convexity, and general geometry of a material can yield information on its catalytic efficiency, solubility, elasticity, porosity, and overall effectiveness in the application of interest. However, material shape can be defined in a multitude of conflicting ways where different aspects of a material's geometry are emphasized over others, leading to bespoke measures of shape that are not easily generalizable. In this paper, we explore the use of Riemannian geometry in the analysis of shape, and show that a Riemannian geometric framework for shape analysis is generalizable, computationally scalable, and can be directly integrated into common data analysis methods. In this framework, material shapes are abstracted as points on a Riemannian manifold. This information can be used to construct statistical moments (e.g., means, variances) and perform tasks such as dimensionality reduction and statistical process control. We provide a practical introduction to the mathematics of shape analysis through Riemannian geometry and illustrate its application on a manufactured/mined granular material dataset provided by Covia Corp. We show that the Riemannian framework can be used to automatically extract and quantify the shape of granular materials in a statistically rigorous manner. © 2023","Computer vision; Data science; Dimensionality reduction; Shape space analysis; Statistical process control","Geometry; Granular materials; Statistical process control; Catalytic efficiencies; Dimensionality reduction; Overall effectiveness; Physical and chemical properties; Riemannian geometry; Shape space; Shape space analyse; Shape-analysis; Space analysis; Statistical process-control; Computer vision","","","A.

Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed (Medline), Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane (Core Collection) databases on May 16, 2023. Literature comparing surgical navigation with a conventional method using postoperative three-dimensional computed tomography imaging was collected. Only articles that studied at least one of the following outcomes were included: technical accuracy (angular accuracy, linear accuracy, volumetric accuracy, and degree of enophthalmos), preoperative and perioperative times, need for revision, complications, and total cost of the intervention. MINORS criteria were used to evaluate the quality of the articles. Results: After screening 3733 articles, 696 patients from 27 studies were included. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate volumetric accuracy and revision rates. Meta-analysis proved a significant better volumetric accuracy (0.93 cm3 ± 0.47 cm3) when surgical navigation was used compared with conventional surgery (2.17 cm3 ± 1.35 cm3). No meta-analysis of linear accuracy, angular accuracy, or enophthalmos was possible due to methodological heterogeneity. Surgical navigation had a revision rate of 4.9%, which was significantly lower than that of the conventional surgery (17%). Costs were increased when surgical navigation was used. Conclusion: Studies with higher MINORS scores demonstrated enhanced volumetric precision compared with traditional approaches. Surgical navigation has proven effective in reducing revision rates compared to conventional approaches, despite increased costs. © 2023 The Authors","Orbital fractures; Orbital implants; Surgery, computer-assisted; Surgical navigation systems; Technical accuracy; Virtual surgical planning","","","","R.

Given the potential negative impact machine learning (ML) can have on people, society or the environment, engineering techniques that can ensure robustness against technical errors and adversarial attacks are of considerable importance. In this work, we investigate how teams of experts develop, deploy and maintain software with ML components. Moreover, we link what teams do to the effects they aim to achieve and provide means for improvement. Towards this goal, we performed a mixed-methods study with a sequential exploratory strategy. First, we performed a systematic literature review through which we mined both academic and grey literature, and compiled a catalogue of engineering practices for ML. Second, we validated this catalogue using a large-scale survey, which measured the degree of adoption of the practices and their perceived effects. Third, we ran validation interviews with practitioners to add depth to the survey results. The catalogue covers a broad range of practices for engineering software systems with ML components and for ensuring non-functional properties that fall under the umbrella of trustworthy ML, such as fairness, security or accountability. Here, we present the results of our study, which indicate, for example, that larger and more experienced teams tend to adopt more practices, but that trustworthiness practices tend to be neglected. Moreover, we show that the effects measured in our survey, such as team agility or accountability, can be predicted quite accurately from groups of practices. This allowed us to contrast the importance of the practices for these effects as well as adoption rates, revealing, for example, that widely adopted practices are, in reality, less important with respect to some effects. For instance, writing reusable scripts for data cleaning and merging is highly adopted, but has a limited impact on reproducibility. Overall, our study provides a quantitative assessment of ML engineering practices and their impact on desirable properties of software with ML components, by which we open multiple avenues for improving the adoption of useful practices.

Unfortunately, a feasible strategy that focuses on the improvement of the semiconducting performance of BDD materials is still lacking and remains a fundamental challenge in material science. Thus, we aim to study the stability and adjustment behaviors of boron dopants in BDD single crystals through post-annealing treatment under high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) conditions. In this work, our study demonstrates that boron dopants show high structural stability, and no extra complex defects were observed during the HPHT annealing process, a superior advantage for the device application in extreme environments. Our work further reveals that the HPHT post-annealing process is effective to eliminate the intrinsic stress and local lattice strain that were inherently formed during the diamond growth process. This process is accompanied by the enhancement of ionization ratio of boron dopants. The carrier content of one 〈111〉-GS BDD increases by more than ten times after post-annealing at 1000 °C and 5.5 GPa, resulting in significant improvement of conductivity by a factor of 2. This result provides an effective strategy to improve the semiconducting performance of BDD materials through HPHT annealing approach and promote their practical device applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Boron-doped diamond; High pressure and high temperature; Semiconductor; Single crystal; Superhard materials","Annealing; Boolean functions; Boron; Diamonds; High pressure engineering; Stability; Annealing process; Boron doped diamond; Device application; Diamond materials; High pressure and high temperature; High-temperature annealing; Performance; Post annealing treatment; Postannealing; Superhard material; Single crystals","","","X.

SICM scanning speed is limited by the conventional raster-type scanning method, which spends most of time on imaging the substrate and does not focus enough on the target area. In order to solve this problem, a target region focused (TRF) method is proposed, which can effectively avoid the scanning of unnecessary substrate areas and enables SICM to image the target area only to achieve high-speed and effective local scanning. TRF method and conventional hopping mode scanning method are compared in the experiments using breast cancer cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells as experimental materials. It was demonstrated that our method can reduce the scanning time for a single sample image significantly without losing scanning information or compromising the quality of imaging. The TRF method developed in this paper can provide an efficient and fast scanning strategy for improving the imaging performance of SICM systems, which can be applied to the dynamic features of cell samples in the fields of biology and pharmacology analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","SICM","Cancer cells; Cells; Cytology; Breast cancer cells; High Speed; Hopping modes; Imaging method; Mode scanning; Scanning ion conductance microscopies; Scanning methods; Scanning speed; Single cells; Target regions; Diseases","","","J.

Switchable superwettability is usually achieved through complex manipulation means and the application of external stimuli such as light, heat, electrical current, and so on. In this study, a reversible superhydrophobic/superoleophobic membrane (PAN@Co-MOF) was fabricated conveniently by in situ growth of Co(Hmim)2 (Co-MOFs) onto the surfaces of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The as-prepared PAN@Co-MOF membrane facilitated the selective passage of water or oil in a unidirectional manner, only when water or oil was prewetted, which enabled the efficient separation of oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions on demand. This novel organic and inorganic hybrid material overcame traditional limitations, resulting in a mechanically robust and reusable membrane. Moreover, the PAN@Co-MOF membrane demonstrated the capability to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for efficient dye degradation through interactions of Co-MOF with diverse liquids. Impressively, the O/W emulsion separation flux surpassed 1600 L·m−2·h−1 with chemical oxygen demand (COD) values of the filtrate below 100 mg·L−1, while the W/O emulsion separation flux exceeded 1040 L·m−2·h−1, maintaining the water content of the filtrate under 50 mg·L−1. Furthermore, the degradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) (50 ppm) achieved a staggering 99.3% within 10 min. This study offers an innovative idea for the development of multifunctional membrane materials with switchable superwettability in the integrated oil–water treatment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Co-MOF; Electrospun PAN; On-demand emulsion separation; Soluble dye removal; Switchable superwettability","Aromatic compounds; Chemical oxygen demand; Computer software reusability; Degradation; Dyes; Emulsification; Emulsions; Hybrid materials; Thermodynamics; Water treatment; Co-MOF; Dye removal; Electrospun polyacrylonitrile; Electrospuns; Emulsion separations; On demands; On-demand emulsion separation; Soluble dye; Soluble dye removal; Switchable; Switchable superwettability; Membranes","","","L.

Ginkgo Folium, the leaf of Ginkgo biloba L., contains biologically active constituents with diverse pharmacological activities. Recent studies have shown promising antitumor effects of the bioactive constituents found in Ginkgo Folium against various types of cancer cells, highlighting its potential as a natural source of antitumor agents. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize its therapeutic potential. Aim of the review: To provide a detailed understanding of the pharmacological activities of Ginkgo Folium and its potential therapeutic benefits for cancer patients. Materials and methods: In this study, we conducted a thorough and systematic search of multiple online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, using relevant keywords such as “Ginkgo Folium,” “flavonoids,” “terpenoids,” “Ginkgo Folium extracts,” and “antitumor” to cover a broad range of studies that could inform our review. Additionally, we followed a rigorous selection process to ensure that the studies included in our review met the predetermined inclusion criteria. Results: The active constituents of Ginkgo Folium primarily consist of flavonoids and terpenoids, with quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, ginkgolides, and bilobalide being the major compounds. These active constituents exert their antitumor effects through crucial biological events such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, autophagy, and inhibition of invasion and metastasis via modulating diverse signaling pathways. During the process of apoptosis, active constituents primarily exert their effects by modulating the caspase-8 mediated death receptor pathway and caspase-9 mediated mitochondrial pathway via regulating specific signaling pathways. Furthermore, by modulating multiple signaling pathways, active constituents effectively induce G1, G0/G1, G2, and G2/M phase arrest. Among these, the pathways associated with G2/M phase arrest are particularly extensive, with the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) being most involved. Moreover, active constituents primarily mediate autophagy by modulating certain inflammatory factors and stressors, facilitating the fusion stage between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Additionally, through the modulation of specific chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases, active constituents effectively inhibit the processes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis, exerting a significant impact on cellular invasion and migration. Synergistic effects are observed among the active constituents, particularly quercetin and kaempferol. Conclusion: Active components derived from Ginkgo Folium demonstrate a comprehensive antitumor effect across various levels and pathways, presenting compelling evidence for their potential in new drug development. However, in order to facilitate their broad and adaptable clinical application, further extensive experimental investigations are required to thoroughly explore their efficacy, safety, and underlying mechanisms of action. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Antitumor; Flavonoids; Ginkgo folium; Ginkgo folium extracts; Terpenoids","","","","J.-S.

Their appeal lies in their exceptional electronic conductivity, room-temperature ferromagnetism, charge density wave (CDW) phenomena, and catalytic properties, among other attributes. Among the diverse array of metallic TMDs, vanadium dichalcogenides (VX2, X = S, Se, and Te) stand out due to their distinctive set of physical and chemical properties. These properties have positioned VX2 materials at the forefront of both fundamental research and technological exploration in fields such as condensed matter physics, materials science, and device physics. In this comprehensive review, we present a thorough investigation of the recent advancements in 2D metallic VX2 materials and related heterostructures in the aspects of their structures, fabrication methods, key properties, and potential applications.

It participates in protein folding via ionic and H-bonds and cation-pi interactions; the charge and hydrophobicity of its side chain make it a disorder-promoting amino acid. Its methylation in histones; RNA binding proteins; chaperones regulates several cellular processes. The arginine-centric modifications are important in oncogenesis and as biomarkers in several cardiovascular diseases. The cross-links involving arginine in collagen and cornea are involved in pathogenesis of tissues but have also been useful in tissue engineering and wound-dressing materials. Arginine is a part of active site of several enzymes such as GTPases, peroxidases, and sulfotransferases. Its metabolic importance is obvious as it is involved in production of urea, NO, ornithine and citrulline. It can form unusual functional structures such as molecular tweezers in vitro and sprockets which engage DNA chains as part of histones in vivo. It has been used in design of cell-penetrating peptides as drugs. Arginine has been used as an excipient in both solid and injectable drug formulations; its role in suppressing opalescence due to liquid-liquid phase separation is particularly very promising. It has been known as a suppressor of protein aggregation during protein refolding. It has proved its usefulness in protein bioseparation processes like ion-exchange, hydrophobic and affinity chromatographies. Arginine is an amino acid, whose importance in biological sciences and biotechnology continues to grow in diverse ways. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Arginine methyltransferases; Cation-pi interactions; Hydrophobic interaction chromatography; Intrinsic disorder; Molecular tweezers; Monoclonal antibody production; Post-translational modification; Protein aggregation; Protein refolding; Protein-protein interactions","Hydrophobicity; Ion exchange; Liquid chromatography; Metabolism; Monoclonal antibodies; Peptides; Phase separation; Positive ions; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Urea; arginine; citrulline; nitrogen oxide; ornithine; urea; Arginine methyltransferase; Cation-pi; Cation-pi interaction; Hydrophobic interaction chromatography; Intrinsic disorder; Methyltransferases; Molecular tweezers; Monoclonal antibody production; Pi interactions; Post-translational modifications; Protein aggregation; Protein refolding; Protein-protein interactions; affinity chromatography; cross linking; human; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; ion exchange; protein aggregation; protein function; protein processing; protein refolding; protein structure; Review; Arginine","","","V.N.

Periporomechanics is a strong nonlocal framework for modeling the mechanics and physics of porous media with evolving discontinuities. In periporomechanics, the horizon that usually lacks a physical meaning serves as a nonlocal parameter. In this article, as a new contribution, we formulate a Cosserat periporomechanics paradigm incorporating a micro-structure related length scale for modeling shear banding and cracking in dry porous media. In this new Cosserat-periporomechanics framework, each material point is endowed with both translational and rotational degrees of freedom following the Cosserat continuum theory. We formulate a stabilized Cosserat constitutive correspondence principle through which classical micro-polar constitutive models for porous media can be used in Cosserat periporomechanics. We have numerically implemented the Cosserat periporomechanics paradigm through an explicit Lagrangian meshfree algorithm. We first present numerical examples to validate the implemented computational Cosserat periporomechanics paradigm for modeling shear bands and cracks. We then present numerical examples to demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the Cosserat periporomechanics for modeling the shear banding bifurcation and crack branching in dry porous media. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cosserat; Cracking; Periporomechanics; Porous media; Shear banding","Computation theory; Continuum mechanics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); 'Dry' [; Cosserat; Deformable porous media; Micro-structures; Nonlocal; Periporomechanic; Physical meanings; Porous medium; Shear-banding; Strain localizations; Porous materials","","","X.

The morphology and shell thickness of the nano-petal could be tuned by changing the reaction time. The resultant Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) HFs exhibited the hollow nanoflower shapes and exposed abundant accessible active sites. The enrichment performance of Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) HFs was approximately 1.4–1.7 times that of spherical Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) composite for benzoylurea insecticides (BUs).

In this work, an ideal Kelvin structure with considering anisotropy is constructed based on the characteristic parameters extracted from a real foam, and the flow and heat transfer characteristics in real and Kelvin foams is numerically investigated and compared by an in-house MRT-TLBM solver accelerated by a GPU. Results demonstrate that when the flow is along the elongation direction of the structure, the permeability is larger and Nusselt number is lower than those in the other directions for both real and Kelvin foams. Compared to the real foam, the Kelvin foam is more prone to inducing turbulence. For the overall performance of flow and heat transfer, the real foam behaves better at small Reynolds number (Rec <750), while Kelvin foam does when Rec exceeds 750 due to the different dominant mechanisms of heat transfer. In particular, the comprehensive factor (θ) of Kelvin foam is 12.8 % larger than that of the real foam at Rec=2000. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Anisotropy; Heat transfer characteristics; Kelvin foam; Permeability; Real foam","Reynolds number; Anisotropic foams; Conjugate heat transfer; Flow and heat transfer; Heat-transfer characteristics; Kelvin foam; Permeability; Pore scale; Porous foams; Real foam; Science and engineering; Anisotropy","","","X.

The ability to host ions is limited in very few polymers, which lack a detailed molecular-level understanding for showcasing the polymer-ion linkage behavior at the interfacial region. In the present manuscript, we have employed sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy to investigate the interfacial structure of a new class phosphazene-based methoxyethoxyethoxyphosphazene (MEEP) polymer in the presence of lithium chloride salt at the air-aqueous interface. The interfacial aspects of the molecular system collected through SFG spectral signatures reveal enhanced water ordering and relative hydrogen bonding strength at the air-aqueous interface. The careful observation of the study finds a synchronous contribution of van der Waals and electrostatic forces in facilitating changes in the interfacial water structure that are susceptible to MEEP concentration in the presence of ions. The observation indicates that dilute MEEP concentrations support the role of electrostatic interaction, leading to an ordered water structure in proximity to diffused ions at the interfacial region. Conversely, higher MEEP concentrations promote the dominance of van der Waals interactions at the air-aqueous interface. Our study highlights the establishment of polymer electrolyte (PE) characteristics mediated by intermolecular interactions, as observed through the spectral signatures witnessed at the air-aqueous interface. The investigation illustrates the polymer-ion linkage adsorption effects at the interfacial region, which explains the macroscopic changes observed from the cyclic voltammetry studies. The fundamental findings from our studies can be helpful in the design and fine-tuning of better PE systems that can offer improved hydrophobic membranes and interface stability for use in electrochemical-based power sources. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","hydrogen bonding network; interface; interfacial water structure; intermolecular interactions; polymer electrolyte; sum-frequency generation","Cyclic voltammetry; Electrostatics; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrophobicity; Interferometry; Sodium chloride; Van der Waals forces; Water treatment; electrolyte; lithium chloride; polymer; sodium chloride; water; Aqueous interfaces; Hydrogen bonding network; Interfacial region; Interfacial water structure; Intermolecular interactions; Phosphazenes; Polymer electrolyte; Spectral signature; Sum frequency generation; Sum Frequency Generation vibrational spectroscopies; adsorption; air; article; chemical structure; controlled study; cyclic voltammetry; energy resource; frequency; hydrogen bond; membrane; pharmaceutics; physical chemistry; static electricity; vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy; water structure; water treatment; Ions","","","K.C.

Objective: This study aimed to assess the association between vitamin D status with night eating habits, sleep quality and depression in female college students. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study studied healthy female students from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Demographic and anthropometric information as well as data on sleep quality and depression were recorded and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured. A 3-day food record questionnaire was completed to assess night eating habits. Data analyses were undertaken using Chi-square, Mann–Whitney U test and logistic regression. A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: The study participants comprised of 272 female students with median (Inter Quartile Range) age of 22 (21–24) years. The majority of the participants (82.3 %) were classified as night eaters, who had higher rates of poor sleep quality compared to non-night eaters (P < 0.05). With 1 ng/ml increase in serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the odds of being a night eater fell by 3 % (OR = 0.97; 95%CI = 0.95, 0.99), and the odds of having depression or poor sleep quality decreased by 5 % (OR = 0.95; 95%CI = 0.93, 0.97) and 6 % (OR = 0.94; 95%CI = 0.91, 0.97), respectively. Conclusion: There was an inverse association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with night eating habits, depression and poor sleep quality. This association needs be confirmed using cohort and interventional studies. © 2023 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Depression; Night eating; Sleep quality; Vitamin D","25 hydroxyvitamin D; carbohydrate; fat; protein; vitamin D; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; body height; body mass; body weight; cross-sectional study; demographics; depression; dietary intake; eating habit; educational status; energy; female; food frequency questionnaire; high performance liquid chromatography; housing; human; human experiment; night; normal human; physical activity; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; prevalence; questionnaire; residence characteristics; sleep quality; sleep time","YL9100HPLC, Waters, United States","Waters, United States","M.

Plants have actively been used for healthcare practices globally since the time immemorial. Medicinal uses of plants have been well recognized in India, evident from plant species documented in different traditional medicinal systems such as Ayurveda (1400–1800 species), Siddha (500–900 species), Unani (400–700 species), Homeopathy (about 372 species), and Sowa-Rigpa (about 250 species), etc. Aim of the study: The primary purpose of this review is to provide systematic updated information on thirteen medicinal plants prioritized by the Indian government (providing75 % subsidy on cultivation cost) based on the availability and market demand of these plants. Updated information regarding the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, quality control, and conservation status of these plants will help in understanding their pharmacological and commercial importance. This will also help in developing new strategies for their conservation. Material and methods: Online databases such as SciFinder, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Google Scholar were used to collect the electronically available literature on targeted thirteen plants. Also, different Indian government official websites such as AYUSH (https://www.ayush.gov.in); NMPB (National Medicinal Plants Board) (https://nmpb.nic.in); e.charak (https://echarak.in) were used for collecting information related to the amount of subsidy, trade and price related information of these plants. Results: To promote medicinal plant cultivation, the Indian government provides subsidies for cultivating some traditionally important medicinal plants. These plants are divided into three categories according to the subsidy provided to farmers, i.e., 30%, 50%, and 75% of the cost of cultivation. Thirteen medicinal plants which are provided 75% subsidy are Aconitum ferox Wall., Aconitum heterophyllum Wall., Aquilaria agallocha Roxb., Berberis aristata DC., Commiphora wightii (Arn.) Bhandari, Nardostachys jatamansi (D.Don) DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Benth. ex Kurz, Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth., Podophyllum hexandrum Royle, Pterocarpus santalinus L.f., Santalum Album L., Saussurea costus (Falc.) Lipsch., and Swertia chirayita (Roxb.) H.Karst. The literature survey reveals the enormous traditional medicinal importance, wide geographical distribution, diverse range of natural products, and broad spectrum of pharmacological activities of these plants. Conclusion: A comprehensive literature survey revealed that although remarkable progress has been made in isolation, bioactivity evaluation, quality assessment, and conservation, there is still a lot of scope for further scientific interventions. Scientific validation of traditionally claimed medicinal potential is lacking for various bioactivities. Some of the bioactivities are performed just on extracts/fractions, so there is a need for proper phytochemical studies to identify active constituents responsible for the specific bioactivity. Further, quality assessment methods using both targeted and non-targeted tools are required to evaluate the quality of these highly-priced medicinal plants and their adulterants. Ultimately, to encourage the cultivation of these endangered medicinal plant species, it is imperative to implement proper legislation and employ in-situ and ex-situ conservation tools. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Analytical studies; Conservation studies; Highly subsidized medicinal plants of India; Phytochemistry; Quality control; Traditional uses","Ethnopharmacology; Medicine, Traditional; Phytochemicals; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Pterocarpus santalinus; Quality Control; Sinopodophyllum hexandrum; phytochemical; plant extract; ethnopharmacology; medicinal plant; phytotherapy; procedures; quality control; traditional medicine","","","U.

The current systematic review collates the evidence for the relationship between exposure to eating-related social media content and people's body image, disordered eating, food consumption, and eating-related opinions. Following PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted on five databases (i.e., Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest), resulting in 38 eligible studies that examined the link between eating-related content and body image, eating behaviour and/or viewers’ perceptions. Evidence showed positive relationships between exposure to certain material on social media (e.g., fast-food advertisements, clean eating, eating videos) and body image concerns, disordered eating, and consumption of, or a willingness to consume the foods seen on social media; however, studies that focused on ‘healthy food’ content showed no such link. Viewers expressed mixed feelings towards content such as nutrition information and mukbang videos which record hosts eating a large amount of food. Future research would benefit from a consistent measure of exposure to different eating-related content. There is also a need for more experimental research to examine the impact of watching different types of eating videos on body image, disordered eating, and food consumption. © 2023 The Authors","Body image; Eating behaviour; Eating-related content; Social media","","","","Y.

Piezo-based motors were used in nanoliter infusion pumps and optical-position systems. These motors needed to arrange a nanometer objective with step rates in MHz reach and inconceivable detail in an appealing motor approach. The power of these motors can go from nanonewtons to around one newton (1N), however, a few motors can accomplish several newtons and motor weight, for small ones, is in the under 10g territory. These are by and large not ""high-power"" motors; however, they should be used for objective applications. Piezo motors are regularly worked as a strain check during a criticism circle for the extra exactness that controls a shut circle circuit. Not exclusively are the essential material science of the Piezo motors, altogether different from that of attractive motors, as the drive prerequisites are additionally extraordinary. An electrical circuit makes acoustic or ultrasonic vibrations in the Piezoelectric material, which produces direct or revolving movement. The Piezo material needs an electric field provided by a voltage differential over the material. Contingent upon the size of the motors, this voltage can be as low as 50 V or as high as 1000 V or more basic Piezo ringers and vibrators ordinarily require just around 25-30 V. There are a few difficulties in the planning of the driver circuits. They are conceivably hurtful high voltages, utilization of proper protection, and wire steering, just as in the killjoy attributes. In contrast to the MOSFET/ IGBT changes used to the stream of current in attractive motors, Piezo motors are typically determined by a standard operational speaker helped by high-voltage semiconductors on their yields or application in explicit to high voltage operation amps. At that point, the attractive motors have an exceptionally inductive burden, so the drive circuit must handle the current in a surge, inductive kicks, and other inductive burden ascribes. While the Piezo motor is profoundly capacitive, the driver operation amp must be fit for giving the required voltage into a heap of 1000 pF (picofarads) or the more yet, stay stable, which requires a unique yield stage configuration regardless of whether the operation amp can undoubtedly show the high voltage. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

In this work, four main steps were carried out using computational materials science. The atom distribution of bulk MPEAs was constructed firstly based on the previously predicted site preference of atoms occupying sublattices, which is beyond the traditional hypothesis that the atom distributing randomly on the whole lattice. Then the (111) close-packed surface slab of CoFeGaNiZn MPEA was obtained by cleaving the bulk structure. Subsequently, the OER processes were systematically explored by calculating the free energy change of intermediates *OH, *O, and *OOH at 171 adsorption sites on the (111) surface. Finally, the oxygen evolution reaction catalytic mechanism and its site preference behavior of FCC_CoFeGaNiZn MPEA were discussed in detail. The results show that atoms have obvious site preference, which deviating the ideal randomly distribution, especially Co, Fe and Zn atoms always prefer to 3c sublattice at all temperature, Ga atoms tend to favor 1a sublattice, and the site preferences of Ni atoms and Ga atoms are affected by the heat treatment temperature. At 1273 K, the site occupying configuration is (Co0.0246Fe0.01680Ga0.4550Ni0.4990Zn0.0046)1a (Co0.2580Fe0.2610Ga0.1150Ni0.1000Zn0.2650)3c. The (111) surface of FCC_CoFeGaNiZn MPEA was based on the site occupying configuration at 1273 K, and it was then supposed to quenched to ground state to simulate the experimental status in the available literature. Since *O at hollow sites transforms into *OOH at a higher overpotential, hollow sites may be poisoning surface sites. Three intermediates are found to primarily participate in the catalytic reaction on top sites. In addition, there are no scaling relationships between ΔE*OH and ΔE*O for CoFeGaNiZn MPEA, even for the same type of top sites. It is noteworthy that an average overpotential of 0.349 V was predicted by considering the combinations of three intermediate-tendency elements, which is in better agreement with the experimental overpotential of 0.37 V at 10 mA/cm2 current density than the overpotential of 0.28 V based on the special quasirandom structures (SQS). Current intensive explorations bring new insights into the OER catalytic mechanism of the preferred adsorption sites of MPEAs based on the reasonable consideration concerning the atoms distributing configuration involving the exact site preference of the constituent metallic atoms on the sublattice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Catalytic mechanism; Computational materials science; Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs); Oxygen evolution reaction (OER); Scaling relationships; Site preference","Adsorption; Catalysis; Free energy; Gallium; Ground state; Oxygen; Reaction intermediates; Adsorption site; Catalytic mechanisms; Computational materials science; Hollow sites; Multi-principal element alloy; Overpotential; Oxygen evolution reaction; Scaling relationships; Site preferences; Sub-lattices; Atoms","","","B.

The authors provide various solutions to resolve this crisis, such as improving training, realigning incentives, and adopting open science practices. Our commentary elaborates on one solution to which they briefly allude: Big Team Science Initiatives (BTSIs). BTSIs allow scholars to address the trustworthiness of our science by facilitating large sample theory testing, sharing and allocating resources, and selecting appropriate research strategies, all of which support the reproducibility and replication of research. Further, we propose that BTSIs may facilitate researcher training, encourage data sharing and materials, and realign incentives in our field. We discuss how BTSIs could be implemented in IO psychology and related fields, identifying and drawing upon similar BTSIs in related disciplines. Thus, our commentary is an extension of the focal article, encouraging scholars to collaboratively address the “crisis of confidence” facing our field using a big team science approach. © 2023 The Authors","Big team science; Big team science initiatives; Large collaborations; Team science","","","","L.M.

In this study, we synthesized LNPs using four nanoprecipitation methods: dialysis, evaporation, dilution, and acidic dilution. Our investigation delved into how these methods affect LNP morphology and properties. Results unequivocally demonstrate the profound impact of the chosen nanoprecipitation method on LNP characteristics. Dialysis and dilution methods yielded LNPs distinguished by their pronounced hollowness, with an average diameter of 330 nm and 430 nm, whereas the evaporation and acidic dilution methods resulted in less hollow structures with average diameter of 270 nm and 800 nm. The duration of unstable conditions during synthesis significantly influenced particle aggregation, giving rise to a broad size distribution. Furthermore, our prepared LNPs showcased exceptional antioxidant activity (>80 % radical scavenging activity at 0.05 mg/mL of LNPs) and potent antibacterial efficacy against gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. This study not only offers crucial insights into optimizing LNP synthesis but also elucidates the nexus between different nanoprecipitation methods and resulting morphology and functionality. The findings provide a fundamental framework for tailoring LNP properties to specific applications, advancing sustainable and eco-friendly technologies within the biomedical, nanotechnology, and materials science domains. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Antibacterial; Antioxidant; Lignin nanoparticle; Morphology; Nanoprecipitation","Agglomeration; Antioxidants; Bacteria; Dialysis; Dilution; Evaporation; Agglomeration; Antioxidants; Bacteria; Dialysis; Dilution; Evaporation; Lignin; Morphology; lignin; nanoparticle; Antibacterials; Average diameter; Bioactive material; Dilution method; Lignin nanoparticle; Nano precipitations; Nanoparticle properties; Nanoparticle structures; Nanoprecipitation method; Sustainable materials; antibacterial activity; antioxidant activity; Article; chemical structure; controlled study; dialysis; dilution; evaporation; morphology; nonhuman; precipitation; Staphylococcus aureus; synthesis; Nanoparticles","","","K.-J.

It is prevalent worldwide, affecting up to 65 million people, with 80% of cases found in lower-income countries. Medicinal plants are commonly employed for managing and treating epilepsy and convulsions due to their unique therapeutic properties. With increasing research and clinical application, medicinal plants are gaining attention globally due to their potent therapeutic effects and fewer side effects. The development of new plant-based antiepileptic/anticonvulsant agents has become a major focus in the pharmaceutical industry. Aim of the review: This article summarizes recent research on medicinal plants with reported antiepileptic/anticonvulsant effects. It provides pharmacological and molecular mechanism of action information for the crude extracts and related active constituents evaluated in preclinical research for the treatment of epilepsy and convulsions, and offers a reference for the development of future related studies in this area. Materials and methods: Articles related to ethnopharmacological and antiepileptic studies on plants or natural products from 2018 to 2023 were collected from PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, etc. using keywords related to epilepsy, medicinal plants, and natural products, etc. Results: Eighty plant species are commonly used to treat epilepsy and convulsions in African and Asian countries. Sixty natural products showing potential for antiepileptic/anticonvulsant effects have been identified from these medicinal plants. These products can be broadly classified as alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids and other compounds. The antiepileptic action of plant extracts and their active ingredients can be classified according to their abilities to modulate the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems, act as antioxidants, exhibit anti-neuroinflammatory effects, and provide neuroprotection. In addition, we highlight that some medicinal plants capable of pharmacologically relieving epilepsy and cognition may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Conclusions: The review highlights the fact that herbal medicinal products used in traditional medicine are a valuable source of potential candidates for antiepileptic drugs. This confirms and encourages the antiepileptic/anticonvulsant activity of certain medicinal plants, which could serve as inspiration for further development. However, the aspects of structural modification and optimization, metabolism, toxicology, mechanisms, and clinical trials are not fully understood and need to be further explored. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Active ingredients; Epileptic seizures; Mechanisms of action; Medicinal plants; Pharmacological activities","Anticonvulsants; Epilepsy; Ethnopharmacology; Humans; Phytochemicals; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Seizures; anticonvulsive agent; phytochemical; plant extract; chemistry; epilepsy; ethnopharmacology; human; medicinal plant; phytotherapy; seizure","","","X.

The complexity of the macroscopic and microscopic deformation phenomena during the machining process makes it challenging to study the damage mechanism of the workpiece. Hence, crystal kinematics equation is established using true stress-true strain theory, and the internal force balance and constitutive model of the crystal are analyzed. The proposed theory is applied to finite element processing and experimental analysis of the workpiece, and the subsurface deformation behavior is studied from a mechanistic perspective.The stress model is employed to explore the plastic flow phenomenon of the material during the machining process, and the influence of stress and shear force on the subsurface of the workpiece is discussed. The theoretical analysis of crystal deformation, based on the principles of materials science and mechanics, uncovers the relationship between subsurface deformation curvature and stress. The study delves into the effects of the grinding process on subsurface damage and deformation by analyzing the phenomena of plastic flow, plastic slip, and plastic winding in the subsurface microstructure. The results indicate that at grinding speed vs = 25 m/s and grinding depth ap = 60 μm, the damage to the subsurface deformation layer is minimal. The grinding process considerably impacts the stress exerted on the workpiece, with an amplitude ranging from 1.255 × 103 to 1.286 × 103. Conversely, the strain on the workpiece is relatively less affected by the grinding process, exhibiting an amplitude of 2.366–3.568. Moreover, when the normal stress and shear force of the abrasive particles form 45° angle, the subsurface deformation of DD5 manifests a distinct slip distortion at an approximate 45° curvature. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Grinding; Single crystal superalloy DD5; Subsurface; True stress-true strain","Nickel; Nickel alloys; Plastic flow; Shear flow; Single crystals; Stresses; Superalloys; Damage mechanism; Grinding process; Single crystal superalloy DD5; Single crystal superalloys; Subsurface; Subsurface deformation; True strain; True stress; True stress-true strain; Workpiece; Grinding (machining)","","","M.

It follows from a rich diversity of their elemental compositions and chemical functionalities. MXenes can form composites with many substances, including polymers or metal oxides, which allows to effective “tune” MXene characteristics to a fit-to-the-purpose applications. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is currently widely studied as advanced desalination technique due to the advantages of cost-effectiveness, eco-friendly, and high salt removal capacity. One of key fields for CDI development relates to the ion's intercalation materials as concept taken from the sodium ion batteries, which is used in CDI because of their excellent desalination capacity. These materials provide effective sodium ions removal from the brine based on intercalation mechanism as well as redox reactions. In this review, we timely review an up-to-date accomplishment in the advancement of distinct MXene-based composite materials used as CDI electrodes, along with discussion of fundamental electrochemical energy storage mechanisms. The most relevant outcomes are highlighted together with the phenomena observed when applied in desalination applications. Finally, potential solutions as well as challenges in this field are summarized. © 2023 The Authors","2D materials; CDI; Electrode; Electrosorption; Ion-selective separation; MXene","Carbides; Carbon nitride; Cost effectiveness; Electrochemical electrodes; Metal ions; Redox reactions; Sodium-ion batteries; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; 2d material; Capacitive deionization; Electrosorption; Hot topics; Ion-selective separation; Mxene; Physical and chemical properties; Selective separation; Transition metal nitrides; Transition metals carbides; brine; chemical property; desalination; electrode; energy storage; pollutant removal; transition element; Desalination","","","G.

Back-Scattered Electron (BSE) images carry information of the mean atomic number in the interaction volume and hence can be used to quantify the phase composition in multiphase materials. Since phase composition and proportion affects the material properties and hence its applications, the segmentation accuracy of such images rendered of critical importance for material science. In this work, the notion of segmentability for BSE images is proposed to define the ability of an image to be segmented accurately. This notion can be used to guide the image acquisition process so that segmentability is maximized and segmentation accuracy is ensured. An index is devised to quantify segmentability based on a combination of the modified Fisher Discrimination Ratio and of the second Minkowski functional capturing intensity and spatial aspects of BSE images respectively. The suggested Segmentability Index (SI) is validated in synthetic BSE images which are generated with a novel algorithm allowing the independent control of spatial distribution of phases and their grayscale intensity histograms. Additionally, SI is applied in real-synthetic BSE images, where the real greyscale distributions of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) clinker crystallographic phases are used, to demonstrate the ability of SI to indicate the optimum choice of critical image acquisition settings leading to the more accurate segmentation output. © 2023","Back-scattered electron imaging; Image acquisition optimization; Multiphase materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Segmentability; Segmentation","Atoms; Electron scattering; Electrons; Image acquisition; Image segmentation; Phase composition; Portland cement; Back-scattered; Backscattered electron images; Backscattered electron imaging; Image acquisition optimisation; Multiphase materials; Segmentability; Segmentation; Segmentation accuracy; Segmentation methods; SEM image; accuracy; algorithm; Article; crystallography; histogram; image segmentation; prediction; scanning electron microscopy; validation study; Scanning electron microscopy","","","M.

A growing number of studies have been focusing on accelerating the process to achieve “rapid composting.” However, the specific definition and influencing factors of rapid composting remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to gather more insight into the features of rapid composting by reviewing the literature concerning organic waste composting published in the Web of Science database in the past 5 years. We selected 1615 sample studies with “composting” as the subject word and analyzed the effective composting time stated in each study. We defined rapid composting within 15 days using the median test and quartile method. Based on this definition, we summarized the influencing factors of “rapid composting,” namely materials, reactors, temperature, and microorganisms. Finally, we summarized two mechanisms related to humus formation during organic waste rapid composting: high temperature-promoting maturation and microbial driving mechanisms. This literature review compiled useful references to help promote the development of rapid composting technology and related equipment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Composting mechanism; Influencing factors; Literature analysis; Organic waste; Rapid composting","Composting; Waste treatment; Composting mechanism; Highest temperature; Humus formations; Influencing factor; Influencing mechanisms; Literature analysis; Organic wastes; Rapid composting; Reactor temperatures; Web of Science; composting; humus; literature review; waste treatment; Soils","","","T.

Due to the crystal structure of the material, some anisotropy of the light output exists, which is dependent on the direction of heavy charged particle recoil relative to the crystal structure. The anisotropy of trans-stilbene (hereafter referred to as stilbene) has been well characterized in previous work, but for deuterated stilbene, the anisotropy has only been partially characterized along the a and b crystal axes, while the artificial c′ axis, which shows the largest anisotropy in stilbene, has not been characterized until this publication. In this work, two deuterated stilbene crystals were characterized with neutron energies up to 35 MeV at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. For one of the crystals, the response is characterized along the a, b, and c′ axes. This characterization shows a distinct anisotropy along the axes in deuterated stilbene, which is very similar to that found in regular stilbene, such that the a axis is the brightest, while the b and c′ axes are approximately 3% and 20%–35% lower relative to the a axis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Deuterated stilbene; Neutron; Passive interrogation; Scintillation; Spectrometer; Spectroscopy; Unfolding","Anisotropy; Charged particles; Crystal structure; Crystals; Deuterium; Spectrometers; Crystals structures; Deuterated stilbene; Fast neutron spectroscopy; Light output; Organic scintillator; Passive interrogation; Spectrum unfolding; Time-of flight; Unfolding techniques; Unfoldings; Neutrons","","","T.C.

Developing seawater agriculture is an important mitigation strategy to address food insecurity. This paper aims to define the policy options for the development of seawater agriculture, based on a marginal efficiency analysis of the seawater agricultural household economic optimisation model. The results indicate that, to develop seawater agriculture, the use of high-tech materials and advanced technology are required along with the use of market-oriented business philosophy and modern management tools to upgrade the agricultural system. In practice, the formulation of development policies regarding seawater agriculture should focus on four aspects: 1) Top-level design planning and optimisation regarding the spatial aspects of seawater agriculture development, 2) increasing fiscal and financial support as well as enhancing the capacity of science and technology, 3) strengthening environmental protection and improving the safety aspects of production, and 4) supporting the diversification of business models and promoting the synergetic development diversified businesses.

Herein, a lightweight aluminum/bismuth oxide/waterborne polyurethane (Al/Bi2O3/WPU) composite foam with asymmetric structure was fabricated by a simple density-induced fillers separation associated freeze-drying process, in which the asymmetric structure was derived from the high-density Al/Bi2O3 sheets deposited at the bottom of composite by the gravity effect during the processing, acting as a low infrared emissivity layer, while the WPU foam formed on the top side as a thermal insulation layer. Through joining the two features in this all-in-one composite foam, it shows a relatively low surface infrared emissivity (0.68), low thermal conductivity (∼48.5 mW·m−1·K−1) and good infrared stealth ability to infrared thermal signal. And the temperature difference of about 48.5 °C can be generated with the hot target at 100 °C. Furthermore, benefiting from the interconnected porous framework, the composite also exhibits good mechanical and thermal stabilities, making it possible for application in various scenarios.

The composite of Pt-CDs/graphene is synthesized via a continuous process of cathodic exfoliation-hydrothermal-impregnation-reduction. Characterization results indicate the distribution configuration of Pt varies from coated structure of CDs@Pt to dispersed configuration of CDs&Pt or Pt&CDs, then to wrapping configuration of Pt@CDs with increased amount of CDs. It's found that suitable introduction of CDs promotes the adjacent plane distribution of Pt species. The obtained best Pt-4CDs/G shows the low overpotential of 36 mV (10 mA⋅cm−2) and high mass activity of 3747.8 mA mg−1 at −40 mV towards electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 9.2 times more active than that of Pt/C (406.2 mA mg−1). The superior HER performance of Pt-4CDs/G is attributed to its relatively adjacent plane distribution of Pt, which supports high electrochemically active surface area and more adjacent Pt sites for H* adsorption. Benefitting from that, the HER process for Pt-4CDs/G favorably follows the Tafel pathway, resulting in low hydrogen adsorption free energy and excellent HER activity. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon dot; Distribution-structure; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Pt","Electrocatalysis; Exfoliation (materials science); Free energy; Gas adsorption; carbon; graphene; hydrogen; Anchorings; Carbon dots; Distribution-structure; Electrocatalytic; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Pt; Pt loading; Strong interaction; Structure modulation; Synthesised; adsorption; Article; catalysis; hydrogen evolution reaction; nonhuman; surface area; X ray diffraction; article; continuous process; pharmaceutics; signal transduction; Graphene","","","M.

This seemingly simple definition, however, needs to be revised since the importance of the human body goes far beyond its biological role. Aim: In anatomical literature, much attention is paid to the human body's material (morphological) aspects. Contrary to such an approach, the presented considerations aim to devote attention solely to the body itself, which for centuries has been an object of interest for scientists and a source of inspiration for artists. Conclusions: With the progress of science and technology, the boundaries and taboos related to the human body are almost constantly changing. Modern anatomy and neuroanatomy can develop in greater depth and breadth, and the human body can be understood in a much more comprehensive range of contexts. Science is increasingly exploring the structure and functioning of the body and, thanks to the development of modern psychology, its association with the mind. © 2023","Gross anatomy; Human body; Philosophy of science","adult; female; human; male; neuroanatomy; philosophy; review; taboo; therapy","","","G.

Notably, as folk medicines, Alchemilla species have long been prescribed for the treatment of dysmenorrhea, pruritus vulvae, menopausal complaints, and related diseases in women. This review summarizes the traditional uses, highlights promising plant species, and focuses on phytochemical and biological studies to highlight future areas of research. Aim of the review: This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Alchemilla species, covering their botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, and biological and pharmacological activities, and to summarize the current research status to better understand the application value of Alchemilla plants in modern phytotherapy. Materials and methods: The search strategy utilized the major thematic platforms Reaxys, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, the USDA Plant Database and Kew Science (Royal Botanic Gardens) and was performed with the term Alchemilla. These platforms were systematically searched for articles published from 1960 to 2023. Results and discussion: Alchemilla species, as members of the Rosaceae family, produce tannins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, coumarins, triterpenes and violet compounds. Effort has been made with this comprehensive review of Alchemilla plants to highlight the recent developments and milestones achieved in modern phytochemistry and phytotherapy, underlaying a broad spectrum of the activities of these plants, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antimicrobial, antiobesity, cardiovascular, anticancer, and wound healing effects. Conclusions: An increasing number of studies on the plants in the Alchemilla genus have provided data about the main constituents and their importance in modern medicine. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that Alchemilla plants possess an extensive spectrum of biological activities. Regardless of the remarkable medical potential of Alchemilla extracts, clinical studies are limited and need to be performed to produce safer and less expensive plant-based drugs. © 2023","Alchemilla; Clinical trials; Pharmacological profile; Phytochemicals; Rosaceae","Alchemilla; Anthocyanins; Ethnopharmacology; Female; Humans; Phytochemicals; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Rosaceae; anthocyanin; phytochemical; plant extract; Alchemilla; chemistry; ethnopharmacology; female; human; medicinal plant; phytotherapy; Rosaceae","","","K.

In this work, Cu7S4 nanowires were grown on copper foam, and coated with N-doped carbon layer and Ag particles, which not only improved the conductivity and local field enhancement regions of the material, but also improved the durability and mechanical stability of Cu7S4. DFT (Density functional theory) calculation shows that different kinds of N doping make the electron difference density and work function of the surrounding C different, which leads to high carrier transport capacity at the interface, and Ag anchored in N-doped carbon films can adsorb O2. The band gap of the material is 2.12 eV, and the material has the potential to generate superoxide anion under energy excitation. Under the condition of 6 V voltage and 1000 mL min−1 water flow rate, the long-term water filtration sterilization of high-concentration bacteria can be realized, and the removal efficiency can still reach 99% after 8 h continuous treatment.

In this study, we present a predictive model that classifies polymers based on their ductility degree, which is a relationship created in the present work to approach this problem. It comes from relating two critical and measurable properties from the tensile test. This target was discretized into three classes, more ductile, intermediate, and less ductile. The feature selection process employed for finding the most relevant molecular descriptors for the predictive model used two approaches: a classical one and an expert-guided one. A new metric, called relaxed %CC, was presented to prioritize the models that reduce the misclassification between the extremes of the ductile scale, which is considered more important than confusion with the intermediate class. Our final model was able to successfully classify polymers, achieving a precision rate of 0.91, an %CC of 89.47 % (traditional accuracy), and a relaxed %CC of 100 % (no extremes confusion). This approach has the potential to help both the industry and R&D by selecting polymers with suitable ductile properties for specific applications during the design stage before their synthesis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Expert-in-the-loop; Machine learning; Tensile test; Thermoplastics","Reinforced plastics; Tensile testing; Thermoplastics; plastic; polymer; thermoplastic; unclassified drug; Ductile behavior; Expert-in-the-loop; Gain insight; Informatics; Machine-learning; Polymer based; Predictive models; Property; Tensile test; Thermoplastic materials; Article; chemical analysis; chemical structure; computer model; controlled study; feature selection; human; information science; machine learning; measurement precision; mechanical test; plastic industry; predictive model; synthesis; tensile test; validation study; Machine learning","","","M.F.

Thus, the researchers apply a set of pre-and post-tests to evaluate the current knowledge of clinicians and students on online IRS. Materials and Methods: The researchers followed repeated measure design in this study. They applied random sampling technique for conducting pre-and post-test assessment. Five scenarios based EBD were developed to evaluate the performance of the participants. The researchers employed two phases in order to achieve the study's objective. In the first phase, 98 clinicians and 70 students were invited to attend three out of five clinical scenarios using IRS. In the second phase, the participants were invited to participate in a 15-min lecture presented by the researchers on the searching strategies and guidelines to apply keywords for searching the evidence using IRS. A significant level of p < 0.05 was obtained from the statistical analysis using the SPSS program version 16. Results: Of the 98 clinicians, only 37 responded to the questionnaire, with a response rate of 37.8 %. On the other hand, out of 70 students, 23 responded to the questionnaire, with a response rate of 32.8 %. In the pre-test, clinicians and students correctly answered 58.3 % of scenario questions. However, the data analysis outcome revealed that only 40.5 % of participants provided a relevant evidence source after an internet search. The students spent an average of 9 min to complete the task, whereas clinicians spent 16 min. After the completion of the lecture, 23 students and clinicians responded to the pre-test, whereas 10 responded to the post-test. Most students believed that the lecture was helpful and recommended similar types of lectures to be presented in the curriculum. The study findings highlight that the percentage of evidence provided in the “pre-test” was 60 %, which was improved in the post-test to 73.3 %. Conclusion: The experimental outcome suggests that internet-based educational applications enhance students' learning strategies. Additionally, the IRS supports clinicians in retrieving effective materials for treating their patients. Furthemore, there is a demand for extracurricular activity to improve the search strategies of clinicians and students to strengthen EBD. © 2023 The Author(s)","","","","","A.K.

The present work deals with one-pot reaction of pyridine-2,6-diamine and terephthalaldehyde in pyrex tube at slightly elevated temperature and resulted in the formation of PDT/COF. The obtained PDT/COF was then functionalized using cobalt (Co@PDT/COF). The formation of COF and metal incorporation is confirmed by Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The simulated AB staggered stacking model for both PDT/COF and Co@PDT/COF correlate well with the observed PXRD pattern than AA eclipsed stacking. The theoretical findings using materials studio software showed increase in the porosity and interlayer spacing after the addition of Co to PDT/COF. The superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity is observed in Co@PDT/COF compared to PDT/COF. Co@PDT/COF was able to produce 13, 24 and 45 μmol g−1h−1 of H2, CH4 and CO, respectively. The obtained experimental optical properties were correlated well with Density functional theory (DFT) studies. Based on the characterization results, mechanism of photocatalysis has been discussed. Good stability and efficiency towards photocatalytic reduction CO2 in presence of the Co@PDT/COF shows its suitability for further research on pyridine based COFs for different applications. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","CO<sub>2</sub> reduction; DFT studies; Metal doping; Photocatalysis; Pyridine based COF","Carbon dioxide; Cobalt; Density functional theory; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Optical properties; Photocatalytic activity; CO 2 reduction; Covalent organic frameworks; Density functional theory studies; Material science; Metal-doping; Ordered structures; Polymer Chemistry; Polymer materials; Pyridine based covalent organic framework; Visible-light-driven; Pyridine","","","M.S.

Belongs to the family Actinidiaceae. Plants of this genus are popularly known as kiwifruits and are traditionally used to treat a wide range of ailments associated with digestive disorders, rheumatism, kidney problems, cardiovascular system, cancers, dyspepsia, hemorrhoids, and diabetes among others. Aim: This review discusses the ethnobotanical uses, phytochemical profile, and known pharmacological properties of Actinidia plants, to understand their connotations and provide the scientific basis for future studies. Materials and methods: The data were obtained by surveying journal articles, books, and dissertations using various search engines such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Web of Science. The online databases; World Flora Online, Plants of the World Online, International Plant Names Index, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility were used to confirm the distribution and validate scientific names of Actinidia plants. The isolated metabolites from these species were illustrated using ChemBio Draw ultra-version 14.0 software. Results: Ten (10) species of Actinidia genus have been reported as significant sources of traditional medicines utilized to remedy diverse illnesses. Our findings revealed that a total of 873 secondary metabolites belonging to different classes such as terpenoids, phenolic compounds, alcohols, ketones, organic acids, esters, hydrocarbons, and steroids have been isolated from different species of Actinidia. These compounds were mainly related to the exhibited antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, anticinoceptive, anti-tumor, and anticancer activities. Conclusion: This study assessed the information related to the ethnobotanical uses, phytochemical compounds, and pharmacological properties of Actinidia species, which indicate that they possess diverse bioactive metabolites with interesting bioactivities. Actinidia plants have great potential for applications in folklore medicines and pharmaceuticals due to their wide ethnomedicinal uses and biological activities. Traditional uses of several Actinidia species are supported by scientific evidences, qualifying them as possible modern remedies for various ailments. Nonetheless, the currently available data has several gaps in understanding the herbal utilization of most Actinidia species. Thus, further research into their toxicity, mechanisms of actions of the isolated bioactive metabolites, as well as scientific connotations between the traditional medicinal uses and pharmacological properties is required to unravel their efficacy in therapeutic potential for safe clinical application. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Actinidia; Pharmacology; Phytochemistry; Toxicity; Traditional medicines","Actinidia; Actinidiaceae; Ethnobotany; Ethnopharmacology; Phytochemicals; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; aldehyde; allergen; anthraquinone derivative; carboxylic acid; ester; fatty acid; flavonoid; herbaceous agent; hydrocarbon; ketone; lignan; phenol derivative; phytosterol; polyphenol; terpene; terpenoid; xanthone derivative; phytochemical; plant extract; Actinidia; Actinidia arguta; Actinidia callosa; Actinidia chinensis; Actinidia coriacea; Actinidia deliciosa; Actinidia eriantha; Actinidia kolomikta; Actinidia macrosperma; Actinidia polygama; Actinidia valvata; Actinidiaceae; analgesic activity; antiangiogenic activity; antibacterial activity; antidiabetic activity; antifungal activity; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; antiproliferative activity; antiviral activity; clinical trial (topic); drug safety; drug structure; ethnobotany; genus; human; Medline; metabolite; nonhuman; pharmacological parameters; phytochemistry; Review; ScienceDirect; search engine; species; SpringerLink; traditional medicine; Web of Science; chemistry; ethnobotany; ethnopharmacology; medicinal plant; phytotherapy","","","G.-W.

Currently these technologies have diversified into versatile waste-to-resource recovery platforms that can synthesize chemicals perform carbon sequestration harvest algae and perform micropollutant abatement. In addition configurations such as microbial desalination cells and bio-electro-Fenton systems are specifically designed for brackish water desalination and advanced oxidation treatment respectively. Nevertheless these configurations suffer from many techno-economical lacunas that impede their development into full-scale technology. For instance a cost-effective oxygen reduction reaction catalyst with reliable performance is still an impending issue. Likewise the scale hierarchy of reactors and declined output efficiency are still a concern in larger bioelectrochemical systems. Many strategies like the exploration of naturally abundant and low-cost materials for reactor component fabrication and integration with existing technologies are viable techniques to boost the technology readiness level of METs. However considerable improvement in materials science and electrochemical aspects is still required to mature these neoteric systems for industrial settings. © 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH.

W.T.Aiton, a herbal medicine for diarrhoea and smooth-muscle cramps is little-known outside Germany, where it has had a market presence for ∼110 years. The early introduction of this Southern African medicinal plant into Europe and the US was entrepreneurially driven, similar to buchu (Agathosma spp.) and Umckaloabo (Pelargonium sidoides DC.). Much of its history of commercialization, from its origin, identity and supply chain to its composition and clinical evidence of efficacy and safety, has been poorly studied and/or scantly published. Aim of the study: The aim of this review is to uncover enough data to create a coherent timeline, many of which are published here for the first time, and to evaluate all published data, mostly historical and/or elusive, to corroborate Uzara's status as a safe and efficacious botanical medicine. Materials and methods: Multiple searches were conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases with the following keywords: all scientific and common plant names combined with taxonomy, nomenclature, ethnobotany, traditional use, ecology, cultivation, sustainability, economy, trade, CITES, chemistry, biochemistry, compounds, pre-clinical, pharmacology, clinical, RCT, safety, toxicology, veterinary, review for the period of 1600–2022. Reference sections of selected publications were searched manually. Additionally, product registration databases of national competent health authorities in Europe were consulted for products, license holders and formulations. Results: The authors find an underutilized potential of uzara as anti-diarrhoeic (with or without underlying infection) and spasmolytic remedy. A by-product of this review is a largely inclusive bibliography of publications on uzara. Conclusions: Further clinical research supporting antidiarrhoeal and spasmolytic efficacy would be desirable. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Antidiarrhoeic; Commercialization; History; Review; Spasmolytic; Uzara; Xysmalobium","Antidiarrheals; Apocynaceae; Ethnobotany; Parasympatholytics; Phytochemicals; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; antidiarrheal agent; herbaceous agent; spasmolytic agent; antidiarrheal agent; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; phytochemical; plant extract; Apocynaceae; drug efficacy; drug safety; ethnobotany; phytochemistry; Review; traditional medicine; Xysmalobium undulatum; chemistry; medicinal plant","","","T.

Thus, this study aimed to systematically review the results of clinical trials that compared the use of cyanoacrylate with conventional sutures after third molars extraction. Materials and methods: Searches were conducted on MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Virtual Health Library (VHL), and Web of Science. Articles published up to February 20, 2022, were included. No restrictions were imposed on data or language of publication. Results: A total of 8 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 3 non-randomized comparative clinical studies) were included in this review and five studies were included in the meta-analysis, comprising 440 patients. The use of cyanoacrylate promoted better results in pain reduction in the first postoperative day when compared to the use of conventional suture (SMD: −1.01; 95%CI -1.90 to −0.12). Cyanoacrylate group promoted significant but borderline edema reduction compared to conventional sutures in the 7th postoperative day (SMD: −0.24, 95%CI -0.46 to −0.01, I2 = 0 %). For the trismus outcome, in all periods evaluated no differences were found between the groups. Conclusion: Although promising results, there is no high-quality evidence to suggest the use of cyanoacrylate was better than conventional sutures. © 2023","Cyanoacrylate; Surgery; Sutures; Third molar","","","","S.G.M.

In this paper, restricted growth of molybdenum carbide nanoparticles in hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Mo2C/NC) was designed and prepared via a salt-assisted template route and carbonization process, whose morphology and the wave-absorbing properties are regulated by changing the content of Mo2C/NC nanoparticles. The honeycomb porous Mo2C/NC composites with large specific surface area and smooth surface can optimize the impedance matching and allow the entrance, multiple reflections and scattering of incident electromagnetic waves (EMW), which effective enhance the electromagnetic wave consumption. Meanwhile, the honeycomb cross-linked carbon matrix facilitates the construction of the conductive network and enhances its conductive loss. Furthermore, numerous Mo2C/NC nanoparticles dispersed restricted growth in carbon matrix induces interfacial polarization. In addition, the heteroatom nitrogen doping acts as dipole centers to induce dipole polarization under electromagnetic field. The uniquely designed Mo2C/NC absorbers show satisfactory EMW absorption behaviors of a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of −61.53 dB at 1.5 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 9.6 GHz at 3.5 mm. This work enriches the variety of EMW absorbers and offers the route to promote the EMW absorption performance, especially large effective absorption bandwidth. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Dipole polarization; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Interfacial polarization; Mo<sub>2</sub>C/NC","Bandwidth; Carbonization; Circular waveguides; Doping (additives); Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Honeycomb structures; Molybdenum compounds; Morphology; Nanoparticles; carbon; molybdenum; nanoparticle; nitrogen; sodium chloride; Absorption performance; Carbon matrix; Dipole polarization; Effective absorption; Electronic science; Electronic technologies; Hierarchically porous; Interfacial polarization; Mo2C/NC; Nitrogen-doped carbons; absorption; adsorption; Article; bandwidth; carbon source; carbonization; combustion; cross linking; desorption; dielectric constant; dipole; electromagnetic radiation; electromagnetism; freeze drying; hysteresis; impedance; isotherm; morphology; polarization; pore size; pore size distribution; porosity; powder; Raman spectrometry; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; surface property; valence (chemistry); X ray diffraction; article; controlled study; dipole; pharmaceutics; polarization; Carbon","","","W.

However, tedious synthesis hinders their application to the laboratory scale hitherto. Here, we develop a facile procedure for the synthesis of CMK-1 and CMK-2 materials cast from narrow-mesoporous hard templates, i.e. MCM-48 and SBA-1, respectively. The proposed recipe is reproducible, operates under mild conditions using basic laboratory equipment and a renewable carbon source (furfuryl alcohol). It relies on the solvent-polarity-controlled deposition of a polar carbon precursor on unmodified silica in a non-polar medium. Such a self-regulating process provides even coverage of the matrix with polymer leading to the formation of carbon mesostructures of exquisite replication fidelity and structural homogeneity while maintaining the primary morphology. The in-depth study of physisorption data employing the dual gas model (simultaneous N2 and CO2 fitting) disclosed the mixed, micro-mesoporous nature of the materials. This tool was found to provide a fair, comprehensive textural characterization, especially useful for materials with pore sizes on the boundary between micro- and mesopores. Therefore, this research paves the way for the manufacturing and application of CMK-1 and CMK-2 carbon replicas on a larger scale. Additionally, it provides certain hints for the robust textural characterization of such materials. © 2023 The Authors","Carbon replica; CMK-1; CMK-2; MCM-48; Nanoreplication; SBA-1","Industrial research; Laboratories; Mesoporous materials; Silica; Solvents; Carbon replica; Chemical science; CMK-1; CMK-2; MCM-48; Mesoporous; Mesoporous matrix; Nanoreplication; SBA-1; Textural characterization; Pore size","","","R.

Detecting mobile heat sources is an essential task in different fields, including fire safety, environmental monitoring, material science, and energy systems. In this investigation, we present an innovative solution to solve the inverse problem of detecting mobile heat sources, utilizing a three-dimensional transient inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) formulation. The goal is to identify a moving heat source from thermographic infrared measurements of the rear face. The proposed method includes a finite volume approach with model reduction techniques to improve computational efficiency. Additionally, we use the conjugate gradient method to solve the inverse problem. We verified the proposed approach by conducting experiments on a metal plate with a moving heat source from a laser and comparing recalculated temperature of the front face with thermocouple measurements. Our results indicate that our method can detect the location and trajectory of the mobile heat source with high accuracy and efficiency. This study also highlighted the limits of source speed that can be detected by this method. This technique could be considered as an excellent option for real-time monitoring of mobile heat sources in practical applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Conjugate gradient; Experimental bench; Infrared thermography; Inverse problem; Model reduction; Moving heat source detection","Computational efficiency; Conjugate gradient method; Heat conduction; Plate metal; Temperature measurement; Thermocouples; Conjugate gradient; Experimental bench; Heat sources; Inverse techniques; Mobile sources; Model reduction; Moving heat source detection; Moving heat sources; Source detection; Surface techniques; Inverse problems","","","M.-B.

The clinically used therapeutic drugs, such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, have no significant therapeutic effect and are accompanied with severe side effects. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in exploring and applying natural herb components for treating ILD. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) possesses innate, non-toxic characteristics and offers advantages in preventing and treating pulmonary ailments. However, a comprehensive study of TCM on ILD therapy has not yet been reviewed. Aim of the review: This review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the monomer components, total extracts, and prescriptions of TCM for ILD therapy, elucidating their molecular mechanisms to serve as a reference in treating ILD. Materials and methods: The literature information was searched in the PubMed, Web of Science databases. The search keywords included ‘interstitial lung disease’, ‘lung fibrosis’ or ‘pulmonary fibrosis’, and ‘traditional Chinese medicine’, ‘traditional herbal medicine’, or ‘herb medicine’. Results: The active components of single herbs, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, and quinones, have potential therapeutic effects on ILD. The active extracts and prescriptions were also summarized and analyzed. The herbs, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Gancao), Astragalus membranaceus Fisch. Bunge. (Huangqi) and Angelicasinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Danggui), play significant roles in the treatment of ILD. The mechanisms involve the inhibition of inflammatory factor release, anti-oxidative injury, and interference with collagen production, etc. Conclusion: This review examines the therapeutic potential of TCM for ILD and elucidates its molecular mechanisms, demonstrating that mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress, modulating the immune system, and promoting tissue repair are efficacious strategies for ILD therapy. The depth research will yield both theoretical and practical implications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-inflammatory; Antioxidant; Interstitial lung disease; Phytomedicine; Traditional Chinese medicine","Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Pulmonary Fibrosis; alkaloid; flavonoid; Glycyrrhiza uralensis root; herbaceous agent; monomer; phenol derivative; quinone derivative; terpenoid; herbaceous agent; Angelica sinensis; Astragalus membranaceus; Chinese medicine; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; herbal medicine; human; interstitial lung disease; nonhuman; prescription; Review; therapy effect; Chinese medicine; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; lung fibrosis; medicinal plant; phytotherapy","","","Y.-L.

For example, such materials can be used in sensors, transducers, energy harvesters, etc. The mathematical model of piezomagnetoelectricity consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations for the electric potential, magnetic potential, and mechanical displacements. We develop multiscale algorithms based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method for solving the piezomagnetoelectricity problem. We consider two ways of constructing multiscale basis functions: split and coupled. In the split approach, we construct the basis functions separately for each field. The coupled approach constructs multiscale basis functions by solving coupled local problems. The split way requires fewer computational resources than the coupled one, but it may give a less accurate solution in the case of a strongly coupled medium. The coupled approach considers the mutual influence of the fields, which is especially important when they are strongly coupled. We use the multiscale partition of unity functions to obtain conforming basis functions for both approaches. We consider two- and three-dimensional model problems to test the effectiveness of the proposed multiscale approaches. On average, the coupled basis functions show better results than the split ones. We also consider the application of the single-step hermitian and skew-hermitian splitting for solving the discrete problem on a coarse grid. The results have demonstrated that one can successfully apply this technique to solving the piezomagnetoelectricity problem on a coarse grid. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Generalized multiscale finite element method; Multiscale method; Piezomagnetoelectric composite; Single-step hermitian and skew-hermitian splitting","Finite element method; Base function; Coarse grid; Generalized multiscale finite element method; Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting; Macroscopic modelling; Multiscale finite element method; Multiscale method; Piezomagnetoelectric composite; Single-step; Single-step hermitian and skew-hermitian splitting; Electric potential","","","D.

As a TCM prescription, it functions to improve blood circulation, reduce blood stasis and eliminate abdominal lumps. Originally used to treat the restlessness of pregnancy due to a mass, it is now also effective in treating gynecological illnesses and various tumors such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and others. With the expansion of clinical applications, GF was developed into different dosage forms, including Guizhi Fuling Pill (GFP), Guizhi Fuling Capsule (GFC), Guizhi Fuling Tablet (GFT), Guizhi Fuling Granule (GFG), and Guizhi Fuling Decoction (GFD). Different dosage forms of GF play an important role in clinical treatment. Aim of the review: To systematically analyze and summarize the research findings concerning the chemical constituents, quality control, pharmacokinetic studies, pharmacological properties, adverse reactions, and clinical applications of GF, so as to point out the problems existing in the current research and provides opinions for future study. Materials and methods: The relevant literatures were collected from classical TCM books and a variety of databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, PubMed, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. All eligible studies are analyzed and summarized in this review. Results: There are some problems for GF: the quality control system is not perfect, the study of pharmacokinetics is not comprehensive, the explanation of pharmacological mechanism is insufficient, and the clinical safety has not been fully verified. A few of research directions for future research are proposed: (i) to establish the method of characteristic components combined with bioassay and multi-index content determination to improve the quality evaluation; (ii) to elucidate pharmacokinetic studies based on human pharmacokinetic characteristics and interaction with intestinal microbiota; (iii) to carry out pharmacological mechanism studies at whole, organ, cellular and molecular levels; (iv) to reconfirm safety of various dosage forms of GF based on large-scale clinical studies. Conclusions: GF is extremely valuable in drug research and in clinical treatment especially for gynecological diseases. However, there are also some issues. Future efforts should focus on strengthening quality control, clarifying pharmacological and pharmacokinetic processes, and reconfirming clinical safety. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical constituents; Clinical applications; Guizhi fuling formulation; Pharmacokinetic studies; Pharmacological properties; Quality control","China; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Quality Control; Tablets; Wolfiporia; acetophenone derivative; diterpenoid; flavonoid; keishi bukuryo gan; monoterpenoid; moutan cortex; phytochemical; radix paeoniae; radix paeoniae alba; radix paeoniae rubra; sesquiterpenoid; tannin derivative; terpenoid; triterpenoid; herbaceous agent; adenomyosis; adverse drug reaction; bioassay; bladder cancer; branchlet; breast cancer; Chinese medicine; cinnamon; CNKI database; drug capsule; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug quality; drug safety; dysmenorrhea; endometriosis; endometrium cancer; human; intestine flora; liver fibrosis; Medline; nonhuman; ovary cancer; ovary polycystic disease; pelvic inflammatory disease; pharmacokinetic parameters; pill; Poria; quality control; Review; search engine; SpringerLink; tablet formulation; uterine cervix cancer; uterus myoma; WanFang Database; Web of Science; China; tablet; Wolfiporia","","","J.

Reclamation of water through traditional desalination and wastewater treatment processes assists in mitigating water crisis; however, these technologies are unsustainable and have a high energy demand. Therefore, the associated environmental impacts and energy paucity have forced humankind to develop sustainable, energy-effective, and economical technology. Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) have gained significant research interest because of their ability for concomitant treatment of wastewater along with the production of bioelectricity by converting chemical energy present in organic substrates using microbial consortia as biocatalysts on either one or both the electrodes. Microbial desalination cell (MDC), a type of BES, has the potential to perform simultaneous wastewater treatment, saline water desalination, and electricity generation. It uses the potential gradient engendered from the oxidation of organic substrate by anodic bacteria to stimulate migration of ions and thus results in desalination. This chapter elaborates on the need for MDCs and concisely summarizes the different configurations of MDCs. Also, different types of catalysts used in MDCs are briefly elucidated, and the applications of MDCs in the treatment of wastewater and resource recovery are extensively reviewed. Besides, existing challenges/limitations of MDCs and future research scope for large-scale implementation are also discussed. This learning will be beneficial for environmental engineers, chemical engineers, materials science researchers, and scientists working in the domain of wastewater treatment. © 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH.

Nevertheless, the diverse array of EES technologies, varying maturity levels, and wide-ranging application scenarios pose challenges in determining its developmental trajectory. Therefore, a comprehensive visual knowledge graph was constructed based on 6806 articles related to EES from the year of 2000 to 2022. This knowledge graph enables the identification of domain-specific research landscape, technological hotspots, frontiers, and evolutionary trends, and it provides insights for future technological research directions. The findings reveal the following: (1) The field of ESS has witnessed a significant surge in publications. China and the United States emerge as the leading contributors in terms of research output.

With the push toward a more digitized industry, emerging trends such as additive manufacturing and the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, along with consumer demand, are resulting in automated development with multiple benefits. Successful applications for small-scale construction projects that have implemented 3D printing have shown improvements in cost, production time, and design freedom and complexity. However, for large-scale applications, there are various limitations and factors hindering the adoption of additive manufacturing technologies. In this paper, a systematic literature survey of recent 3D printing technologies was conducted specific to the area of construction engineering, and the various techniques, materials, software, and technical and nontechnical aspects were analyzed. The key applications and their benefits are outlined, and their potential for large-scale applications is articulated. Future research areas for these components are suggested to strengthen the technical readiness and feasibility of adopting 3D printing technology in construction engineering and industries. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Additive manufacturing; Concrete printing; Industry 4.0; Material science; Mechanical properties; Rheology properties; Three-dimensional (3D) printing","Additives; Construction industry; Industry 4.0; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Concrete printings; Construction engineering; Current construction; Large-scale applications; Material science; Printing technologies; Rheology property; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; 3D printing","","","A.

OBJECTIVE: To review the application advances of magnetically responsive hydrogels in bone tissue engineering. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, WanFang and CNKI databases were used to search relevant literature. The English search terms were “Magnetic Hydrogels, Magnetic Nanoparticles, Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles, Fe3O4, SPIONs, Magnetic Fields, Bone Regeneration, Bone Repair, Bone Tissue Engineering”. The Chinese search terms were “Magnetic Hydrogel, Magnetic Nanoparticles, Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles, Magnetic Field, Iron Oxide Nanoparticles, Bone Regeneration, Bone Reconstruction, Bone Repair, Bone Tissue Engineering”. After preliminary screening of all articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 60 articles were finally retained for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) In recent years, due to the emergence of magnetic nanoparticles, more and more magnetic responsive scaffold materials have been developed. Among them, magnetic responsive hydrogels containing iron oxide nanoparticles and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have outstanding mechanical properties and good biocompatibility. It can quickly respond to the external magnetic field and provide the magnetic-mechanical signals needed for seed cells to form bone. (2) Magnetic-responsive hydrogel can be used as a carrier to accurately regulate the release time of growth factors. (3) Under the three-dimensional microenvironment culture platform based on magnetically responsive hydrogel, the magnetic force at the interface between the magnetic response hydrogel and cells can activate cell surface sensitive receptors, enhance cell activity, and promote the integration of new bone and host bone. (4) The injectable magnetically responsive hydrogel can be used in the field of magnetic hyperthermia and biological imaging of bone tumors. (5) At present, magnetically responsive hydrogels are expected to mimic the anisotropic layered structure observed in natural bone tissue. However, most of the studies on magnetically responsive hydrogels focus on in vitro studies, and the mechanism of interaction between magnetically responsive hydrogels and the local microenvironment in vivo is still insufficient. (6) Therefore, based on the successful application of magnetic nanoparticles in magnetic resonance imaging, it is expected to optimize the properties of magnetic nanoparticles in the future to construct magnetic responsive hydrogels with suitable degradation properties, mechanical properties, and vascular functionalization, which can monitor changes in vivo in real time. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

An unoptimized post-synthesis recipe, which constitutes the last step, is the major hindrance in achieving a reproducible and scalable production strategy of layered bulk WS2 crystals. We have reported a comprehensive study on the crystal, morphological, and luminescence properties of WS2 material which have undergone post-synthesis treatment i.e. dried at mild temperature with varied dwelling times. The as-synthesized WS2 material which used to be in distorted 1T metallic phase, due to ionic intercalation released from the organic reactants, was found to evolve crystallographically into a stable 2H semiconducting phase with increased drying temperature and dwelling time. An in-depth optical analysis of the WS2 nanostructures through PL and PLE spectroscopy revealed substantial improvement in the intensity of A and B excitonic features for the sample dried at 80 °C for 24 h, indicating a reduction in the non-radiative defect centers in the sample under the post-synthesis conditions. We believe an effective post-synthesis treatment is needed for semiconducting 2H-WS2 synthesis through the solution route to improve its crystal (i.e. structural) and optical properties for potential electronic applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrothermal synthesis; Mechanical exfoliation; Photoluminescence (PL); Photoluminescence excitation (PLE); WS<sub>2</sub> nanostructures","Chlorine compounds; Exfoliation (materials science); Housing; Hydrothermal synthesis; Nanostructures; Optical properties; Tungsten compounds; Dwelling time; Excitonics; Mechanical exfoliation; Photoluminescence; Photoluminescence excitation; Post-synthesis treatment; Postsynthesis; Synthesised; WS2 nanostructure; Photoluminescence","","","N.

This study conducted a literature review to identify proposed risks and benefits of “natural” compared to “traditional” burial practices, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes further research questions. The approach was multidisciplinary, including literature from soil, environmental, forensic, and archaeological sciences, and the Humanities. Results identified that here are some clear environmental benefits to natural burial, such as habitat creation and aboveground biodiversity. However, there is a substantial deficit of research that compares the unseen risks and benefits of natural burial practice. Multiple potential risk factors include: (i) groundwater contaminated with biochemical products of decomposition, pathogens, and pharmaceutical products, (ii) atmospheric emissions, including greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O). There is also a deficit of information related to the release of cadaver decomposition products to soil ecological processes. More detailed scientific research is required to identify the risks and benefits of funeral options, thus develop fit for purpose regulations and legislation and to describe the cultural incentives for natural burial. This paper identifies key areas of research required to understand and mitigate the potential environmental and cultural implications of human burial practices. © 2023 The Authors","Environmental impact; Funerary practice; Natural Burial; Soil; Soil ecosystem services","","","","M.

Hydrous sulfate minerals are abundant throughout this region, but one area in Ius Chasma includes phyllosilicates, opal, and additional materials with unusual spectral features. This study at Geryon Montes, an east-west horst that divides Ius Chasma into a northern and southern canyon, exploits recent advances in image calibration and feature extraction techniques for analysis of hyperspectral images acquired by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM). Specifically, a unique spectral “doublet” feature with absorptions at 2.21–2.23 and 2.26–2.28 μm is isolated at the border of phyllosilicate-bearing and sulfate-bearing regions in Ius Chasma and surveyed to characterize outcrops that may represent a changing climate on Mars. We document and map three distinct forms of this “doublet” material in relation to phyllosilicates and opal. Analyses of compositional maps derived from CRISM overlain on High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) imagery has revealed the presence of these hydrated outcrops along the wall rocks below a breach in the Geryon Montes, bordering a canyon containing abundant hydrated sulfates.

It has been widely used in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and promote the recovery of spinal cord function, but underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Aim of the study: The objective of this study was to confirm the neuroprotective effects of the SQSR pill. Materials and methods: A rat model of chronic compression at double-level cervical cord was used in vivo. The protective role of SQSR pill on CSM rats was measured by Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale, inclined plane test, forelimb grip strength assessment, hindlimb pain threshold assessment, and gait analysis. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined by Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay, and apoptosis was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The expression of apoptosis proteins was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Results: SQSR pill could facilitate locomotor function recovery in rats with chronic cervical cord compression, reduce local ROS in the spinal cord and downregulate the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)/caspase-3 signaling pathway. In addition, the SQSR pill could protect primary rat cortical neurons from glutamate-treated toxicity in vitro by reducing the ROS and downregulating the phosphorylation of JNK and its downstream factors related to neuronal apoptosis meditated by the caspase cascade. Then, the neuroprotective effect was counteracted by a JNK activator. Conclusions: Together, SQSR pill could ameliorate neuronal apoptosis by restraining ROS accumulation and inhibiting the JNK/caspase-3 signaling pathway, indicating that SQSR pill could be a candidate drug for CSM. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","c-Jun-N-Terminal kinase; Cervical spondylotic myelopathy; Neuronal apoptosis; Reactive oxygen species; Shenqisherong pill","Animals; Apoptosis; Caspase 3; Cervical Cord; Neuroprotective Agents; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Spinal Cord Injuries; caspase 3; Chinese medicinal formula; dichlorofluorescein; glutamic acid; hydroethidine; protein Bax; reactive oxygen metabolite; shenqisherong; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; caspase 3; neuroprotective agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; brain cell; cervical spinal cord; cervical spondylotic myelopathy; controlled study; forelimb; gait; grip strength; hindlimb; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mitochondrion; neuroapoptosis; neuroprotection; nonhuman; pain threshold; pill; protein phosphorylation; rat; signal transduction; spinal cord compression; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; animal; metabolism; signal transduction; spinal cord injury; Sprague Dawley rat","","","X.-J.

Rapid advances in materials science and nanomedicine have brought endless possibilities for the cure of brain diseases. The ideal depth of tissue penetration, precise and controllable therapeutic dose, and noninvasive nature of ultrasound (US) make it an unprecedented superiority in brain applications. Therefore, the US-stimulated multifunctional nanosystems have been extensively explored to meet the numerous requirements in the treatment of brain diseases. This article reviews and highlights recent advances in the utilization of US and micro/nanoparticles for the treatment of brain diseases, including common but intractable ones such as glioblastoma, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and so on. The composition and function of US-sensitive nanoplatforms based on different therapeutic principles are elaborated for different pathological mechanisms, and the validation of their in vitro and in vivo therapeutic effects are also introduced in detail. Finally, we discuss the biosafety issues closely related to future clinical translation, as well as some potential challenges and promising prospects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Biomaterials; Brain diseases; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticles; Ultrasound","","","","H.

Chitosan, natural clay of local origin, montmorillonite, zeolite, cross-linking agents (epichlorohydrin, sodium tripolyphosphate, glutaraldehyde) and plasticisers (glycerol) were used to synthesise composites. The composites were characterised by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), tested for their antibacterial activity and used in batch experiments to study the adsorption of caesium, cobalt and europium ions. The maximum capacities for adsorption of caesium, cobalt and europium on the composites were 1400 mg/g, 900 mg/g and 18 mg/g, respectively. The experimental data fit better the Langmuir isotherm model and indicate favourable monolayer adsorption of Cs+, Co2+ and Eu3+ at homogeneous sites of the composites. The experimental data were in better agreement with the pseudo-second-order non-linear kinetic model for most elements and adsorbents. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system proved to be a practical tool with good performance and generalisation capability for predicting the adsorption capacity of composites for caesium, cobalt, and europium ions. It was found that the predicted data were very close to the experimental data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Aluminosilicate minerals; Caesium; Chitosan; Cobalt; Europium","Adsorption; Biodegradability; Cobalt; Dyes; Environmental technology; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Isotherms; Monolayers; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium compounds; X ray powder diffraction; Zeolites; aluminum silicate; cesium; chitosan; cobalt; epichlorohydrin; europium; glutaraldehyde; glycerol; montmorillonite; tripolyphosphate; zeolite; Aluminosilicate minerals; Cesium ions; Cobalt ion; Cross linking agents; Europium ions; Low-costs; Natural clays; Natural materials; Non-toxicity; Science technologies; adsorption; aluminosilicate; environmental protection; isotherm; polysaccharide; adsorption; antibacterial activity; Article; attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; controlled study; cross linking; fuzzy system; isotherm; kinetics; X ray diffraction; Chitosan","","","G.

Recently, these AMR microbes have become difficult to treat, as they have rendered the existing therapeutics ineffective. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective alternatives to lessen or eliminate the current infections and limit the spread of emerging diseases under the ""One Health"" framework. Bacteriophages (phages) are naturally occurring biological resources with extraordinary potential for biomedical, agriculture/food safety, environmental protection, and energy production. Specific unique properties of phages, such as their bactericidal activity, host specificity, potency, and biocompatibility, make them desirable candidates in therapeutics. The recent biotechnological advancement has broadened the repertoire of phage applications in nanoscience, material science, physical chemistry, and soft-matter research. Herein, we present a comprehensive review, coupling the substantial aspects of phages with their applicability status and emerging opportunities in several interdependent areas under one health concept. Consolidating the recent state-of-the-art studies that integrate human, animal, plant, and environment health, the following points have been highlighted: (i) The biomedical and pharmacological advantages of phages and their antimicrobial derivatives with particular emphasis on in-vivo and clinical studies. (ii) The remarkable potential of phages to be altered, improved, and applied for drug delivery, biosensors, biomedical imaging, tissue engineering, energy, and catalysis. (iii) Resurgence of phages in biocontrol of plant, food, and animal-borne pathogens. (iv) Commercialization of phage-based products, current challenges, and perspectives.

This perspective article summarises the authors' joint view on zeolite chemistry's future direction for catalytic applications to stimulate discussion identifying pillars on which the scientific community should focus. Particular challenges discussed here include i) our view of the zeolite synthesis focused on new structures with optimised textural properties and design of zeolite catalysts with precise control of the location of active sites; ii) discussion of current, mostly new industrial, requests for zeolitic catalysts; iii) emerging catalytic applications in which zeolites should play a key role; and last but not least iv) opportunities for new types of microporous solids. Although some of these are rather challenging, with many barriers to overcome, we suggest fostering research on these directions as the key to maintaining the crucial role of zeolite as catalysts. Discussion on the future role of zeolite science and technology is organised in consideration of three possible future scenarios: (i) a low-carbon BAU (business-as-usual) scenario and (ii) two advanced scenarios, which differ in terms of the degree of circularity (low and high, LC and HC respectively), and (iii) level of substitution of fossil fuels with alternative energy and carbon sources. Trends characterising these scenarios and their impact on zeolite science and technology are discussed to provide the readers with the elements, tools and clues to identify priorities in research and application of zeolite catalysts. © 2023 The Authors","Chemical production; Circularity; FCC; Low-carbon scenario; Refinery; Zeolites","Carbon; Catalyst activity; Fossil fuels; Catalytic applications; Chemical production; Circularity; FCC; Low carbon; Low-carbon scenario; Refinery; Science and Technology; Zeolite catalyst; Zeolite science; Zeolites","","","G.

In this study, a novel green-fabrication method with UiO-66 catalysts and amine-functionalized chitin nanofibers (ChNFs) was suggested to prepare durable and highly reactive membranes for decomposing chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in the continuous flow system. The strong interaction between ChNFs and the UiO-66 led to stable loading of the UiO-66 on the continuous nano-porous channel of the ChNF reactive membrane even with high loading of UiO-66 (70 wt% of UiO-66 in the ChNF substrate). In addition, the Brønsted base functionalities (–NH2 and –NHCOCH3) of the ChNF enhanced the catalytic activity and recyclability of the UiO-66. The resulting 70-ChNF composites can effectively decompose a nerve agent simulant (methyl paraoxon) even after 7 repeatable cycles, which has been not obtained in the previous UiO-66 catalyst. The ChNF/UiO-66 reactive membranes with 1 m2 of the area decomposed 130 g of CWAs within an hour in a continuous flow system. We believe these robust and highly reactive membranes can provide a sustainable and efficient solution for the massive CWA disposal and also contribute to the advancement of functional membrane material science. © 2023","Chitin nanofiber (ChNF); Metal-organic framework (MOF); Organophosphate; Reactive membrane","Acetone; Aerogels; Catalyst activity; Chemical warfare; Membranes; Nanofibers; Organometallics; aerogel; amine; chemical warfare agent; chitin nanoparticle; metal organic framework; nanomaterial; nerve gas; organophosphate; paraoxon; Chemical warfare agents; Chitin nanofiber; Continuous-flow system; Fabrication method; Functionalized; Metal-organic framework; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Organophosphate; Reactive membranes; ]+ catalyst; article; catalysis; catalyst; membrane; nonhuman; Chitin","","","K.-Y.

A promising time- and cost-effective alternative is staining with the fluorescent dye Nile red (NR). This review covers the wide range of NR staining methods, illumination conditions, and instrumentation for fluorescence-based detection and classification that have been developed thus far, highlighting the potential of NR fluorescence imaging to distinguish plastics. Despite notable advancements in NR staining techniques and conditions that have strengthened detection capabilities, there remains a need for further development and standardization of NR staining protocols, fluorescence imaging methods, and illumination instruments. We conduct a thorough assessment of both the advantages and limitations associated with diverse fluorescence imaging instruments, image segmentation, and classification techniques employed for detecting NR fluorescence and identifying polymer species. We also highlight critical considerations that should guide future research efforts to establish NR staining as a comprehensive, standalone method for environmental monitoring. They include investigating fluorescence behavior, especially intensity and Stokes shift, to understand the impact of solvent functional groups, plastic materials, additives and color pigments, weathering and application methods on NR sorption and fluorescence. Consideration of these factors will improve the ability to accurately identify polymer types based on their fluorescent behaviors, promoting widespread adoption of fluorescence imaging as a standalone method and enhancing cross-compatibility between NR studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental Monitoring; Image Classification; Image Segmentation; Optical Imaging; Plastic Pollution","","","","K.G.

The genus Balanophora (Balanophoraceae) consists of 23 accepted species. These species are the most controversial flowering plants, with highly reduced morphologies and are found parasitizing on the roots of their host. They have been used in traditional medicine as a remedy for stomach pain, detumescence, uterine prolapse, wounds, syphilis, gonorrhea, treating injuries from falls, and other conditions. However, there is no review of this genus on its traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology. Aim: The present narrative review discusses the scientific data supporting the traditional uses of Balanophora species. The available information on its botanical properties, traditional uses, chemical contents, pharmacological activities, and toxicity was summarized to help comprehend current research and offer a foundation for future research. Materials and methods: The materials used in combining data on the genus Balanophora comprises online sources such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for Chinese-related materials. World Flora online was used in validating the scientific names of this genus while ChemBio Draw Ultra Version 22.2 software was employed in drawing the phytochemical compounds. Results: Nine Balanophora species including B. harlandii, B. japonica, B. polyandra, B. fungosa, B. fungosa subsp. indica, B. laxiflora, B. abbreviata, B. tobiracola, and B. involucrata have been documented as vital sources of traditional medicines in different parts of Asia. A total of 159 secondary metabolites have been isolated and identified from the ten species of this genus comprising tannins, flavonoids, sterols, lignans, chalcones, terpenes, and phenylpropanoids. Among these compounds, tannins, lignans, terpenoids, chalcones and phenolic acids contribute to the pharmacological activities of the species in this genus with several biological activities both in vitro and in vivo such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, hypoglycemic activity, cytotoxicity, anti-microbial, melanin synthesis etc. Conclusion: This review summarizes the available literature on the traditional uses, pharmacological properties, and phytoconstituents of Balanophora species indicating that they contain fascinating chemical compounds with diverse biological activities. The traditional uses of the species in this genus have been confirmed by scientific data such as antimicrobial, hemostatic effect, gastroprotective activity and others. However, many species in this genus are yet unknown in terms of their botanical uses, chemical composition and biological activities. Thus, more research into the scientific connections between traditional medicinal uses and pharmacological activities, mode of action of the isolated bioactive constituents, and toxicity of other Balanophora species is needed to determine their efficacy and therapeutic potential for safe clinical application. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Balanophora; Pharmacology; Phytochemistry; Toxicity; Traditional uses","Balanophoraceae; Chalcones; Lignans; Medicine, Traditional; Tannins; chalcone derivative; lignan; tannin derivative; Balanophoraceae; traditional medicine","","","G.-W.

However, finding safe and efficient hydrogen storage materials has become a key obstacle to achieving a sustainable hydrogen economy. This paper proposes that exploring hydrogen storage property of synthesized biphenylene network (Fan et al., Science, 372:852-6 (2021)) is an effective way to overcome the obstacle. In this work, Li-decorated biphenylene networks with different proportions of B were systematically constructed. The structures, thermal stability, diffusion barriers, and hydrogen storage characteristics were explored. The electron-deficient B can significantly enhance the Li binding energy, and increase the diffusion energy barrier to prevent metal aggregation, which is better than N doping. The hydrogen adsorption energies are just within the ideal range to facilitate hydrogen desorption. When the pressure is 0.1 MPa, the critical temperature is 230–310 K. The hydrogen storage capacities of Li-decorated B-doped biphenylene network change from 6.30 wt% to 19.22 wt% with the increase of Li atomic concentration from 7.69 % to 25.00 %, exceeding the ultimate onboard hydrogen storage goal set by DOE. Considering the hydrogen storage density and metal polymerization, Li-decorated B-doped BPNs have excellent hydrogen storage properties compared with transition metal-decorated carbon material systems and alkali metal-decorated N-doped BPN systems. Therefore, Li-decorated B-doped BPNs are a kind of carbon material with great potential for hydrogen storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","B-doped; Biphenylene; Hydrogen storage; Li decorated","Binding energy; Carbon; Diffusion barriers; Doping (additives); Fossil fuels; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen fuels; Transition metals; Alternative to fossil fuels; B-doped; Biphenylene; Carbon material; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen storage materials; Hydrogen-storage properties; Li decorated; Synthesised; Hydrogen storage","","","L.-J.

Due to the presence of free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, alginates can be easily modified by different chemical modification methods. The development and use of chemically modified alginates is one of the hotspots in the field of food science. This paper first summarized the molecular chemical nature of alginates. Then, this paper reviewed the chemical modification methods of alginates. Third, this paper analyzed the product types of chemically modified alginates. Fourth, this work discussed the food application of chemically modified alginates. Finally, this paper provides a summary and outlook of the chemically modified alginates for food research. The chemical modification methods can be classified into five types: ionic complexation with cationic substances, covalent bond modification of the hydroxyl groups, covalent bond modification with the carboxyl groups, step-by-step covalent bond modification, and synergistic modification of covalent bond methods with ionic complexation. The product types are dependent on their roles as minor (emulsions and model foods) or main (foams, fibers, spheres, films, 3D printed scaffolds, and environment-determined hydrogels) components. The food application can be classified into five types: functional active substances, gelling agents, emulsifying agents, materials for food encapsulation, and materials for food packaging and preservation.

Herein, an aqueous ultrasonic method is applied to exfoliate bulk half metallic C(CN)3 into ultra-thin atomic layered C(CN)3 nanosheets. It found that after 20 h of ultrasonic treatment, the as-obtained C(CN)3-20 presents a significantly improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. The CO production rate reaches 285.3 μmol g−1 h−1, fiftyfold of the bulk C(CN)3. The significant improvement in photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the following factors: (1) exfoliation reduces the particle size and increases the specific surface areas of the material. Thus, the atomic utilization efficiency is improved; (2) the bandgap of the material is enlarged after exfoliation, while suitable bandgap further promotes photocatalytic CO2 conversion; (3) the optimized surface defect concentration enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect of defect regulation and band engineering on photoelectric property modulation for metal-free organic C(CN)3, enabling highly selective and efficient CO2 photoconversion. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Band engineering; Defects regulation; Exfoliation; Ultra-thin nanosheets","Carbon dioxide; Energy gap; Energy policy; Exfoliation (materials science); Particle size; Surface defects; Band engineering; CO 2 reduction; Defect engineering; Defect regulation; Exfoliation; Metal free; Organics; Photo-catalytic; Ultra-thin; Ultra-thin nanosheet; Nanosheets","","","Y.

This hinders our ability to discern the reasons behind a program's success or failure and to determine optimization and adaptation strategies. To unravel this “black box,” we present a case study using implementation science to evaluate a PE program and illuminate the mechanisms linking process to outcome. The study examines a 4.5-year PE program at a construction company, targeting musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) from material-cart handling. Using the RE-AIM framework and Implementation Causal Pathway Model, we evaluated implementation process and catalogued contextual factors through worker surveys (n = 106), safety document review (27 training sessions and 7 construction projects), and key informant observations. We assessed the program's impact using a 42-worker survey and an analysis of 8-year injury data, and determined the return-on-investment (ROI) by monetizing the collected data. The program achieved significant impact: Workers' ergonomic knowledge improved from 73% in baseline to 86% in follow-up; 97% of workers reported at least one positive change in their crews; and no cart handling injuries occurred after the first program change, resulting in a ROI rate of 1.99. Implementation process evaluation revealed that seamless integration, tailored intervention, and ongoing adjustments contributed to the success. Five organizational factors necessary for the effective functioning of these three strategies were identified, along with three moderators that amplified their influence. Finally, this case study demonstrates that implementation science offers a coherent structure for evaluating PE programs, uncovering mechanisms of change, and informing future improvements and adaptations. Our research facilitates knowledge transfer from implementation science to ergonomics, eventually leading to more cost-effective PE programs that are faithfully implemented across various industrial settings to prevent MSDs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Implementation science; Participatory ergonomics","Construction Industry; Ergonomics; Humans; Implementation Science; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Occupational Diseases; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Materials handling; Case-studies; Continuous improvements; Implementation process; Implementation science; Musculoskeletal disorders; Participatory ergonomics; Programme failures; Project success; Returns on investment; Workers'; Article; building industry; economic aspect; ergonomics; human; implementation science; investment; knowledge; musculoskeletal disease; occupational health; program cost effectiveness; signal transduction; work environment; worker; ergonomics; implementation science; musculoskeletal disease; occupational disease; Ergonomics","","","Z.

At present, the incidence of PF has increased significantly around the world. The therapeutic arsenals against PF are relatively limited, with often poor efficacy and many adverse effects. As a conventional and effective therapeutic strategy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely applied in treating lung fibrosis for thousands of years in China. Due to the multi-ingredient, multi-target characteristics, Chinese medicines possess promising clinical benefits for PF treatment. Aim of this review: This review aims to systematically analyze the clinical efficacy of Chinese medicine on PF, and further summarize the relevant mechanisms of Chinese medicine treating PF in preclinical studies, in order to provide a comprehensive insight into the beneficial effects of Chinese medicines on PF. Methods: Eight major Chinese and English databases were searched from database inception up to October 2022, and all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of Chinese medicine intervention on effectiveness and safety in the treatment of PF patients were included. Subsequently, preclinical studies related to the treatment of PF in Chinese medicine, including Chinese medicine compounds, Chinese herbal materials and extracts, and Chinese herbal formulas (CHFs) were searched through PubMed and Web of science to summarize the related mechanisms of Chinese medicine against PF. Results: A total of 56 studies with 4019 patients were included by searching the relevant databases. Total clinical efficacy, pulmonary function, blood gas analysis, lung high resolution CT (HRCT), 6 min walk test (6-MWT), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, clinical symptom scores, TCM syndrome scores and other outcome indicators related to PF were analyzed. Besides, numerous preclinical studies have shown that many Chinese medicine compounds, Chinese herbal materials and extracts, and CHFs play a preventive and therapeutic role in PF by reducing oxidative stress, ameliorating inflammation, inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and myofibroblasts activation, and regulating autophagy and apoptosis. Conclusion: Chinese medicines show potential as supplements or substitutes for treating PF. And studies on Chinese medicines will provide a new approach to better management of PF. © 2023","Chinese medicine; Clinical practice; Mechanism; Pulmonary fibrosis; Review","Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Fibrosis; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; 3 (3,4 dihydroxyphenyl)lactic acid; andrographolide; Angelica sinensis extract; arctigenin; arctiin; asiaticosdide; astragaloside IV; Astragalus extract; atractylodin; baicalin; berberine; calycosin; catalpol; Chinese drug; Chinese medicinal formula; cryptotanshinone; curcumin; ecliptasaponin a; emodin; ferulic acid; gallic acid; ganoderic acid a; ginsenoside Rg 1; glycyrrhizic acid; gypenoside; herbaceous agent; hydroxysafflor yellow a; icaritin; isoandrographolide; isoliensinine; luteolin; magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate; magnesium lithospermate; magnolol; nagilactone d; neferine; osthole; paeoniflorin; Panax notoginseng extract; peonol; piceid; puerarin; safflor yellow; saikosaponin d; salidroside; salvianolic acid A; salvianolic acid B; schizandrin B; scutellarein; sodium houttuyfonate; tanshinone IIA; triptolide; unclassified drug; herbaceous agent; adult; aged; autophagy (cellular); blood gas analysis; cell activation; Chinese medicine; clinical practice; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; inflammation; lung fibrosis; lung function; male; mouse; myofibroblast; nonhuman; oxidative stress; questionnaire; Review; six minute walk test; systematic review; total lung capacity; vital capacity; x-ray computed tomography; Chinese medicine; fibrosis; lung fibrosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment outcome","","","B.

Among them, 13 species have been traditionally used as folk medicines in Asia and other parts of the world to treat blood diseases, abnormal bleeding, skin diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, liver diseases, bone injury, lung diseases, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tonic, cancer, eye diseases, menstrual irregularities, inflammation, rheumatism, diabetes mellitus, rattlesnake bite, internal parasites, contraceptive, vomiting and diarrhea. Aim of the study: To date, no comprehensive review on Toxicodendron has been published and the scientific basis of the traditional medicinal benefits of Toxicodendron have been less reported. Therefore, this review aims to provide a reference for further research and development on medicinal purpose of Toxicodendron by summarizing the works (from 1980 to 2023), and focusing on its botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology. Materials and methods: The names of the species were from The Plant List Database (http://www.theplantlist.org), World Flora Online (http://www.worldfloraonline.org), Catalogue of Life Database (https://www.catalogueoflife.org/) and Plants for A Future Database (https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx). And the search terms “Toxicodendron” and “the names of 31 species and their synonyms” were used to search for information from electronic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, Baidu Scholar, Springer, and Wiley Online Library. Moreover, PhD and MSc dissertations were also used to support this work. Results: These species on Toxicodendron are widely used in folkloric medicine and modern pharmacological activities. So far, approximately 238 compounds, mainly phenolic acids and their derivatives, urushiols, flavonoids and terpenoids, are extracted and isolated from Toxicodendron plants, commonly, T. trichocarpum, T. vernicifluum, T. succedaneum, and T. radicans. Among them, phenolic acids and flavonoids are the main compound classes that show pharmacological activities in Toxicodendron plants both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the extracts and single compounds of these species show a wide range of activities, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, liver protection, fat reduction, nerve protection, and treatment of blood diseases. Conclusions: Selected species of Toxicodendron have been used as herbal medicines in the Southeast Asian for a long time.

Machine-learning methods are increasingly accelerating the development of these relationships by treating microstructure evolution as a pattern recognition problem, discovering relationships explicitly or implicitly. These methods often rely on identifying low-dimensional microstructural fingerprints as latent variables. However, using inappropriate latent variables can lead to challenges in learning meaningful relationships. In this work, we survey and discuss the ability of various linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods including principal component analysis, autoencoders, and diffusion maps to quantify and characterize the learned latent space microstructural representations and their time evolution. We characterize latent spaces by their ability to represent high-dimensional microstructural data in terms of compression achieved as a function of the number of latent dimensions required to represent the data accurately, their accuracy based on their reconstruction performance, and the smoothness of the microstructural trajectories in latent dimension. We quantify these metrics for common microstructure evolution problems in material science including spinodal decomposition of a binary metallic alloy, thin film deposition of a binary metallic alloy, dendritic growth, and grain growth in a polycrystal. This study provides considerations and guidelines for choosing dimensionality reduction methods when considering materials problems that involve high dimensional data and a variety of features over a range of lengths and time scales. © 2023 The Author(s)","Autoencoders; Diffusion maps; Dimensionality reduction; Pattern evolution; Phase-field simulation","Binary alloys; Clustering algorithms; Deposition; Economic and social effects; Grain growth; Microstructure; Principal component analysis; Spinodal decomposition; Auto encoders; Diffusion maps; Dimensionality reduction; Dimensionality reduction method; Latent variable; Metallic alloys; Micro-structural; Microstructure evolutions; Pattern evolution; Phase-field simulation; Learning systems","","","R.

We tested if nuclear allelic composition data sourced from eDNA can resolve fine scale spatial genetic structure of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia calliptera in Lake Masoko, Tanzania. In this ∼35 m deep crater lake the species is diverging into two genetically distinguishable ecomorphs, separated by a thermo-oxycline at ∼15 m that divides biologically distinct water masses. We quantified population genetic structure along a depth transect using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from genome sequencing of 530 individuals. This population genetic structure was reflected in a focal set of SNPs that were also reliably amplified from eDNA — with allele frequencies derived from eDNA reflecting those of fish within each depth zone. Thus, by targeting known genetic variation between populations within aquatic eDNA, we measured genetic structure within the focal species. © 2023 The Authors","Environmental science; Evolutionary biology; Genetics; Techniques in genetics","","","","M.J.

Recent advances in additive manufacturing (AM) have enabled us to fabricate sophisticated architected materials with high precision. To increase and diversify applications in both science and engineering practice, the rapid development of fabrication technologies necessities a novel and effective algorithm to outline a theoretical property space for material design problems, allowing designers to acknowledge the limitations of material performance, and to make informed trade-off between target objectives and competing industrial requirements. Inspired by biological evolution, the proposed work addresses a methodology for intuitively mapping material-property spaces of CMMs by using the genetic algorithm as a sampling algorithm, consisting selection of objective properties and stochastic search of property points. It approximates the property space more faithfully and comprehensively than traditional mapping approaches. Considering the manufacturing defects of the AM, uncertainties in properties are quantified via the deep learning method. Variations of properties induced by the defects are illustrated as stochastic boundaries of the property space. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cellular metamaterials; Genetic algorithm; Material property space; Neural network; Numerical homogenization; Uncertainty effects","Deep learning; Defects; Economic and social effects; Learning systems; Mapping; Metamaterials; Stochastic systems; Cellular metamaterial; Cellulars; Material property space; Mechanical; Neural-networks; Numerical Homogenisation; Property; Property spaces; Uncertainty; Uncertainty effects; Genetic algorithms","","","S.

Over the past two decades, molecular imprinted polmers (MIPs) have been developed as synthetic receptors or substitute materials for antibodies due to their high stability, short time needed for electropolymerization, and high specificity towards the target analyte. However, the sensitivity of electrochemical sensors decreased as a result of MIPs' low conductivity and lack of electrocatalytic activity. To overcome this limitation, nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (GR), titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx), carbon dots (CDs), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), and black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) and their nanocomposites have been employed as biosensing transducers to construct MIPs based on electrochemical biosensors for cost-effective detection of biological molecules with high sensitivity and specificity. This is because the high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and ease of functionalization of nanomaterials all increase MIP sensitivity to targeted biological molecules. When these advantages of nanomaterials are combined with those of electrochemical methods, such as rapid response time, ease of use, low cost, and miniature ability, MIPs based on nanomaterial-modified electrodes are widely preferred tools for sensing AA, DA, and UA. Herein, this review provides insight into recent developments in the application of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanomaterial-based electrochemical biosensors for detecting biological molecules, including AA, DA, and UA. The integration of nanomaterials with MIPs into electrochemical biosensors has led to an unprecedented impact on improving the limit of detection of biomolecules, indicating great potential for use in public health and medical care. © 2023 The Author(s)","Ascorbic acid; Dopamine; Electrochemical sensors; MIPs; Nanomaterial; Uric acid","","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","22141804","","","","English","Sens.

Materials and methods: A comprehensive search strategy was conducted in the following original databases: PubMed, Web of Science (ISI), Scopus, Psycinfo, and national databases, including the Scientific Information Database (SID) and MagIran, from January 1988 through January 2023. Studies that reported the prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors among high school students in Iran were included. Two investigators extracted all relevant data independently. For deriving mean prevalence rates, random-effects meta-analyses were used. We assessed the quality of studies by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Results: Total of 67 studies (45,798 participants) were included in the syntheses on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. For depressive symptoms, the mean prevalence rate was 48 % (40 %, 55 %). 2804 participants were enrolled for assessing of the prevalence of suicide ideation, and the mean prevalence rate was 21 % (6 %, 36 %). The meta-analysis pooling of the prevalence estimates of suicide attempts was 18 % (15 %, 20 %). Conclusions: Approximately half of the high school students experience depressive symptoms and, astonishingly, one in five high school students experiences suicidal ideation, so to identify strategies for preventing and treating depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors in this special population, further research and policymaking are urgently needed. © 2023","Depressive symptoms; High school; Meta-analysis; Students; Suicidal behaviors","Depression; Humans; Iran; Prevalence; Students; Suicidal Ideation; adolescent; depression; female; high school student; human; Iranian (citizen); Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist; male; Medline; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; prevalence; PsycINFO; publication bias; Review; Scopus; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; systematic review; Web of Science; depression; Iran; meta analysis; prevalence; student; suicidal ideation","","","H.

In this study, we present a novel electrochemical proton injection method via an in situ fuel cell process, demonstrating proton conduction in europium oxide (Eu2O3) through a surficial conduction mechanism for the first time. By tuning Eu2O3 into a protonated form, H-Eu2O3, we achieved an exceptionally high proton conductivity of 0.16 S cm−1. Distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis was employed to investigate the proton transport behavior and reveal the significant contribution of surface proton transport to the overall conductivity of Eu2O3. Remarkably, H-Eu2O3 exhibited a low activation energy for ionic transport, comparable to the best ceramic electrolytes available. The proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism describes this novel surficial proton conduction mechanism. These findings provide new possibilities for developing advanced proton conductors with improved performance. © 2023 The Authors","Electrochemical energy conversion; Energy application; Materials science","","","","B.

After the efficient exfoliation in MnSO4 electrolyte, the stacked graphite expands into open structure, with vertical graphene sheets strongly bonded on the surface. This unique architecture not only provides sufficient surface areas for the anchoring of oxygen vacancy-enriched MnO2, but also ensures transportation pathways for the charge transfer and electrolyte ions diffusion. Thus, the resultant electrode exhibits an areal specific capacitance of 447.5 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 and promising cycling stability. It outperforms the analogues exfoliated in another Mn-based electrolyte because of the anion effect.

The structural properties of CSMOF and their derived material include extortionate specific surface area and porosity, good structural flexibility, high stability, etc. These appealing properties make CSMOF a great alternative for various practical applications. CSMOF has shown great performance as an electrode material for energy storage applications. This review is primarily focused on the factor affecting the assemblies and synthesis of core shell structures, strategy to control the assemblies, synthesis methods, and properties of different CSMOFs for energy storage devices viz. supercapacitors (SC) and batteries. After that, different CSMOF structures are compared in terms of their performance parameters for SC including specific capacitance, capacitance retention, cyclic stability, energy density, and self-discharge.On the other hand, reversible capacity, initial discharge capacity, and cyclic stability are a few performance parameters for Li-ion batteries that are also discussed for different materials.CSMOF's applications for some other batteries like Na-ion, K-ion, Li-S, Li-Se, and Li-O2 will likewise be discussed in other sections. Eventually, the expansion and future scope of CSMOF and its derivatives are proposed for upcoming energy storage applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Core-shell MOF; Energy storage; Li-ion batteries; Supercapacitor; Surface area","","","","S.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of biomechanical research on the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures using cephalomedullary devices. Methods: Following the PRISMA-P guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed on 31.12.2022. The databases PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched. Scientific papers published between 01.01.2000 – 31.12.2022 were included when they reported data on implant properties related to the biomechanical stability for intertrochanteric fractures. Data extraction was undertaken using a synthesis approach, gathering data on criteria of implants, sample size, fracture type, bone material, and study results. Results: The initial search identified a total of 1459 research papers, out of which forty-three papers were considered for final analysis. Due to the heterogeneous methods and parameters used in the included studies, meta-analysis was not feasible. A comprehensive assessment of implant characteristics and outcome parameters was conducted through biomechanical analysis. Various factors such as proximal and distal locking, nail diameter and length, fracture model, and bone material were thoroughly evaluated. Conclusion: This scoping review highlights the need for standardization in biomechanical studies on intertrochanteric fractures to ensure reliable and comparable results. Strategies such as avoiding varus, maintaining a sufficient tip-apex-distance, cement augmentation, and optimizing lesser trochanteric osteosynthesis enhance construct stability. Synthetic alternatives may offer advantages over cadaveric bone. Further research and meta-analyses are required to establish standardized protocols and enhance reliability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Biomechanical; Cephalomedullary nail; Hip fracture; Intertrochanteric","","","","J.

Traditional Chinese medicine has been proven to have favorable efficacy on DN, especially Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM), one of the most critical and conventional herbs in the treatment. Over the past decades, studies have demonstrated that SM is a potential treatment for DN, and the exploration of the underlying mechanism has also received much attention. Aim of this review: This review aims to systematically study the efficacy and pharmacological mechanism of SM in the treatment of DN to understand its therapeutic potential more comprehensively. Materials and methods: Relevant information was sourced from Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI databases. Results: Several clinical trials and systematic reviews have indicated that SM has definite benefits on the kidneys of diabetic patients. And many laboratory studies have further revealed that SM and its characteristic extracts, mainly including salvianolic acids and tanshinones, can exhibit pharmacological activity against DN by the regulation of metabolism, renal hemodynamic, oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, autophagy, et cetera, and several involved signaling pathways, thereby preventing various renal cells from abnormal changes in DN, including endothelial cells, podocytes, epithelial cells, and mesangial cells. Conclusion: As a potential drug for the treatment of DN, SM has multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway pharmacological effects. This work will not only verify the satisfactory curative effect of SM in the treatment of DN but also provide helpful insights for the development of new anti-DN drugs and the application of traditional Chinese medicine. © 2023","Diabetic nephropathy; Efficacy; Pharmacological mechanism; Salvia miltiorrhiza; Traditional chinese medicine","","","","L.

In this study, we successfully developed a flexible film electrode by incorporating derivatives of Mo and Fe-based polyoxometalates (POMs-D) into carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The integration of CNFs significantly enhanced the structural stability of POMs-D, while the internally formed electrical field facilitated efficient electron transfer, resulting in good performance in sodium storage. The film electrode demonstrated a high capacitive contribution of 90.0 % for sodium uptake/release at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1. It maintained a capacity of approximately 170 mA h g−1 even after 8000 cycles at a current density of 3.0 A g−1. Moreover, the film electrode exhibited a decent capacity with a 40.0-fold increase in current density, along with high power capability and energy density in sodium-ion hybrid supercapacitors, showcasing the versatility. These findings unveil the structure-functionality relationship and offer an advanced approach for developing high-performance film electrode materials, opening new possibilities in the fields of material science and energy storage. © 2023 The Author(s)","Carbon nanofibers confinement; Flexible self-supporting electrode; Hybrid supercapacitors; Polyoxometalate derivative; Pseudocapacitive contribution","Adhesives; Carbon nanofibers; Density (specific gravity); Density functional theory; Energy storage; Metal ions; Oxides; Sodium; Stability; Storage (materials); Supercapacitor; carbon nanofiber; iron; molybdenum; polymer; polyoxometalate derivative; sodium ion; unclassified drug; Carbon nanofiber confinement; Carbon nanofibres; Energy density; Film electrodes; Flexible self-supporting electrode; Hybrid supercapacitors; Polyoxometalate derivative; Polyoxometalates; Pseudocapacitive; Pseudocapacitive contribution; Article; chemical structure; current density; electric field; electrochemical analysis; electron transport; electrospinning; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; polymerization; Raman spectrometry; scanning electron microscopy; sodium metabolism; sodium storage; sodium transport; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; Electrodes","","","J.

Based on the idea of the convex splitting method, we split free energy into the difference between two convex functionals. The convexity provides an appropriate choice of linear stabilization parameter. A linear and temporally second-order accurate algorithm is constructed utilizing the implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta method. In each time step, we can analytically prove that the proposed scheme satisfies the energy dissipation law. The Fourier spectral method is used to perform spatial discretization.

Currently, physical exercise, cognitive intervention, and combined physical and cognitive intervention have been proven to be effective interventions. However, whether combined interventions can provide additional benefits than single interventions remains unclear. Thus, the systematic and meta-analysis was conducted to explore the immediate and retention effects of combined physical and cognitive interventions, in comparison with a single intervention. Materials and methods: Randomized controlled trials of combined interventions on FOF in older adults were searched using Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from inception to March 20, 2023. The risk of bias in included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Two independent researchers extracted the data using predetermined criteria. Results: 31 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. For the immediate post-intervention effect, the combined intervention was more effective than the blank/placebo/conventional intervention and the single cognitive intervention, while no additional effect was observed compared with the single physical intervention. Moreover, no additional follow-up retention effects were found when comparing the combined intervention with the single intervention. Conclusions: Combined interventions had positive immediate effects on FOF in older adults, compared with single cognitive intervention, while combined interventions had a similar effect as a single physical intervention. More well-designed studies are required to explore the additional benefits of combined interventions compared with a single intervention and to investigate the follow-up effects of combined interventions. © 2023","Cognitive therapy; Exercise therapy; Fear of falling; Older adults; Systematic review","Aged; Cognition; Exercise; Fear; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; attention; behavior change; cognitive behavioral therapy; cognitive rehabilitation; cognitive restructuring; cognitive therapy; executive function; exercise; fear of falling; human; intermethod comparison; kinesiotherapy; memory; meta analysis; publication bias; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; aged; cognition; fear","","","M.

Results: The level of care dependency for hygiene is the key variable in predicting the use of an urinary incontinence intervention. The ability to adopt an appropriate body posture, being urinary incontinence prior to admission into a nursing home and being diagnosed with dementia are identified as significant predictors. Residents care independent for hygiene and for adopting an appropriate body posture and urinary incontinence before admission into a nursing home are more likely to use absorbing material. In residents being care dependent for hygiene and for adopting an appropriate body posture and diagnosed with dementia, a combination of absorbing material with toileting or other interventions are mostly applied.

These three parameters can be sensed simultaneously by combining space division multiplexing (SDM) and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). FM-MCF naturally contains an inner core and an outer core, and it is etched until the outer core is exposed. Therefore, the inner core can be employed to calculate the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) of LP01 and LP11 through distributed temperature and strain, and the outer core can be used to sense SRI through the BGS of LP01. Note that due to the high corrosion of the outer core, the higher order mode is cut off, so only the LP01 mode can be observed in the outer core. By demodulating the Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) of the BGS in the outer core and the inner core, the proposed sensor has a maximum temperature sensitivity of 1.7220 MHz/°C, a maximum strain sensitivity of 0.0783 MHz/με, and an SRI sensitivity of 274.3245 MHz/RIU around 1.440 RI unit (RIU). Therefore, we show a new perspective for discriminative sensing of multi-parameter in Brillouin distributed sensors based on SDM. The developed multifunctional fiber sensor could find application in the field of environmental sensing, materials science, biomedical applications, and structural health monitoring. © 2023","Few-mode multi-core fiber (FM-MCF); Multi-parameter sensor; Sample refractive index; Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS); Strain; Temperature","Corrosion; Fibers; Frequency modulation; Medical applications; Stimulated Brillouin scattering; Structural health monitoring; Brillouin gain spectrum; Core fibre; Few-mode multi-core fiber; Inner core; Multi-cores; Multi-parameter sensor; Sample refractive index; Simultaneous sensing; Space division multiplexing; Stimulated brillouin scattering; Refractive index","","","H.

Ciguatera poisoning (CP) is the most commonly reported non-bacterial seafood-related illness worldwide and is caused by the consumption of fish or shellfish containing ciguatoxins (CTXs), a class of polycyclic polyether marine biotoxins with highly complex chemical structures. Reliable laboratory testing in clinical samples for CTXs is not available and many analogues remain structurally unresolved. CTXs have a proposed backbone size of 3 nm but have never been directly observed. Herein, the first purported images of CTX-3C obtained by Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) and in the presence of gold nanoparticles with attached antibodies by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are presented. TEM image was captured based on a sample preparation optimization technique using anti-ciguatoxins CTX-3C [1C49] Ab00350–1.1 purified antibodies, gold nanoparticles, and a concentration of synthetic CTX-3C molecules combined for imaging. We discuss how other existing instrumentations with atomic resolutions exceeding <0.1 nm could be applied using this preparatory method to observe, with greater detail, the common backbone of all known CTXs and its proposed wider adoption towards other marine biotoxins. Conventional detection methods for marine toxins have drawbacks, applying cutting-edge existing technologies such as TEMs to directly observe never-before-seen marine toxins can contribute to the fundamental science of marine toxins research. © 2023 The Author(s)","Ciguatoxins; Cryo-EM; CTX; Marine biotoxins; TEM; Toxin detection method; Transmission electron microscope","Antibodies; Electrons; Fiber optic sensors; Gold nanoparticles; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Meats; Metal nanoparticles; Toxic materials; Ciguatoxin; Cryogenic electron microscopy; Detection methods; Marine biotoxin; Marine toxins; Toxin detection; Toxin detection method; Transmission electron; Transmission electron microscope; Cryogenics","","","C.R.

Among various MOFs, Zn-EDTA compounds have shown potential for electrochemical applications. This paper presents the accident discovery and investigation of a new anhydrous Zn2(EDTA) MOF and its electrochemical performance as an electrode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. The study systematically explores the influence of pH and stoichiometric ratio on the formation of Zn2(EDTA) and Zn2(EDTA)(H2O) MOFs using X-ray diffraction analysis. The single-phase anhydrous Zn2(EDTA) compound is synthesized, offering advantages over the hydrated form regarding stability and electrochemical activity. Zn2(EDTA) structure is characterized, revealing a 3D network of channels suitable for interstitial ionic mobility. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to study the thermal behavior of Zn2(EDTA), showing two weight loss steps attributed to water and carbon dioxide elimination during decomposition. Electrochemical measurements using cyclic voltammetry in alkaline and neutral electrolytes demonstrate the electrochemical activity of Zn2(EDTA) as an anode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. The results suggest that the electrochemical process in both electrolytes involves the reversible stripping/deposition of zinc ions. The anhydrous Zn2(EDTA) MOF exhibits higher peak current intensities and more positive potentials than the hydrated form. The study provides valuable insights for synthesizing and controlling Zn2(EDTA) MOF formation, opening the prospects for searching for new structures in considered-to-be-studied phase regions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Battery; Hydrothermal synthesis; pH control; Single crystal; Zn-EDTA MOF","Alkalinity; Anodes; Carbon dioxide; Crystal structure; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrolytes; Hydration; Hydrothermal synthesis; Metal ions; Organometallics; Sodium-ion batteries; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray powder diffraction; Zinc compounds; Battery; Electrochemical activities; High surface area; Hydrated forms; Material science; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); PH control; Property; Sodium ion batteries; Zn-EDTA metal-organic framework; Single crystals","","","I.A.

This property can be altered by the method of tooth fabrication, the material, the chewing force, and the relationship to the antagonist tooth. This systematic review evaluated the wear resistance of artificial teeth obtained by the additive manufacturing method and aims to answer the question, “Do artificial teeth for dental prostheses obtained by additive manufacturing show wear resistance similar to prefabricated ones?” The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Checklist guidelines were followed with a customized search in Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Embase, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases on August 30, 2023. The inclusion criteria were artificial teeth for dental prostheses in acrylic resin by additive manufacturing and comparing the wear resistance with conventional prefabricated teeth, in vitro and English studies, without time restriction. And excluded if 1) do not make artificial teeth by additive manufacturing or that were metal or ceramic teeth; 2) clinical trials, animal studies, review articles, case reports, letters to the editor, short communication, book chapters; 3) another language that is not English. The selection was in two steps, reading the titles and abstracts, followed by reading the selected studies in full. The risk of bias analysis was performed with the adaptation of the quasi-experimental studies tool by Joanna Briggs Institute. Four hundred and twelve articles were found in the databases, after the selection steps and application of eligibility criteria, 6 articles were included for qualitative data analysis and presented low risk of bias. For teeth obtained by additive manufacturing, 2 studies reported lower wear resistance, 2 studies had higher resistance, and 2 similar compared to prefabricated ones. Additive manufactured teeth compared to prefabricated teeth show influences on wear resistance due to differences in material composition, relationship to the antagonist's tooth, applied force, chewing cycles, and processing methods. © 2023","Additive manufacturing; Artificial teeth; Systematic review; Wear resistance","","","","A.

Methods: Articles published until April 2023 were retrieved from electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct) according to Boolean operators, and the reference lists of the included articles were manually searched. The included articles were all full-text, original studies in English that assessed the effects of LC SDF compared with SDF alone. The risk of bias in the in vitro studies on dental materials was evaluated with the modified Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. Results: Six studies (five in vitro and one ex vivo) were included in qualitative analysis after a comprehensive manual search and electronic database search. Every study compared LC SDF versus non-LC SDF in terms of properties such as penetration depth, silver ion precipitation, dentine hardness, surface morphology and anti-bacterial characteristics. Four studies were categorised as low quality with a high risk of bias, whereas the remaining two studies were considered high quality with a low risk of bias. Conclusion: In this investigation, LC SDF, compared with non-LC SDF, was found to be an efficacious approach for enhancing SDF properties. Future high-quality studies, particularly randomised clinical trials, remain necessary to verify these findings. Clinical significance: The use of light curing with SDF can be a beneficial strategy that enhances SDF's clinical use. This review comparing various properties of LC SDF and non-LC SDF may help clinicians enhance clinical use and patient acceptance of LC SDF. © 2023 The Authors","Dental caries; Dental health; Light curing; Silver diamine fluoride; Systematic review","dental material; diamine; fluoride; silver; silver diamine fluoride; unclassified drug; adult; antibacterial activity; controlled study; dental light-curing; ex vivo study; human; in vitro study; Review; systematic review","","","M.S.

This approach has garnered considerable interest across multiple fields, such as chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry, primarily due to its inherent simplicity, precision, and cost-effectiveness. However, it is essential to recognize that frequently used MagLev configurations, including standard MagLev and axial MagLev, are not without their limitations. These configurations often struggle to strike a balance between levitation performance, ease of operation, and visibility. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new MagLev configuration to address the aforementioned issue. Results: This work describes the development of an innovative MagLev, termed “asymmetric MagLev”, achieved by combining a ring magnet and a cylinder magnet as up-down asymmetric magnetic field sources. The asymmetric design overcomes the physical obstacles along the centerline of the standard MagLev, offering unique open-structure advantages, including easy handling of samples, the ability to observe samples from the top or bottom, and no restrictions on the container height. Meanwhile, comparative analysis reveals a considerable enhancement in the working distance of the asymmetric MagLev without significantly sacrificing the measurement range compared to the axial MagLev. Notably, the asymmetric MagLev achieves a remarkable sensitivity of up to about 1.8 × 104 mm (g cm−3)−1, surpassing the axial MagLev by approximately 30 times. Furthermore, experimental results validate the successful application of the asymmetric MagLev in density measurement and quality detection of small-sized objects. Significance: This pioneering configuration represents the first utilization of up-down asymmetric magnets in the field of MagLev.

In metallurgy, however, substantial work remains to be done when computing critical mechanical properties of metals (e.g., strength, ductility, hardness, etc.). This is due to three distinct characteristics of metals that are, in this combined form, not necessarily relevant for predicting other properties (e.g., elastic constants). First, metals are inherently multiscale and, so, simulating realistic microstructures may require millions of atoms. On the other hand, to be predictive, MLIPs must be trained on quantum-mechanical simulations that are limited to a few hundred atoms, which raises the question of transferability to larger systems. Second, there are quantum-mechanical effects, such as magnetism, that are not yet to full extent accounted for in the functional form of state-of-the-art MLIPs. Third, the search space of metallic alloys spans over billions of compositions, and screening for the best possible alloy is like searching for the needle in the haystack without sophisticated high-throughput methods. While the concept of MLIPs is extremely promising regarding quantitative accuracy and automation, these challenges must be addressed in the years to come in order to lift computer-aided materials design to the next level. This review attempts to provide a state-of-the-art survey of ongoing developments towards achieving this goal. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Active learning; Atomistic simulations; Computer-aided materials design; High-throughput screening; Machine-learning potentials; Mechanical properties","Computational chemistry; Computer aided instruction; Quantum theory; Active Learning; Atomistic simulations; Computational materials science; Computer aided materials design; High throughput screening; Interatomic potential; Learning potential; Machine-learning; Machine-learning potential; State of the art; Machine learning","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","09270256","","CMMSE","","English","Comput Mater Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179137997"

In this study, heterogeneous structures of AZ61 alloy bars with anisotropic gradients (with different grain size distributions from the surface to the center) were observed to exhibit strong strength-ductility synergies under different deformation temperatures. The results reveal that the grain refinement process under medium-low temperature deformation conditions (≤ 350 °C) consists of four transition stages along the radial direction, i.e., twin activations and deformation band formations, dislocation cells and pile-ups, ultrafine sub-grains, and randomly orientated quasi-micron grains. Different deformation temperatures have a great influence on twin activations and deformation band formations, and the high temperature can easily provoke the initiation of non-basal slip. The deformation bands were determined as a primary nucleation site due to their highly unstable dislocation hindrance ability. Analysis in combination with the Radial forging (RF) deformation process, the differences of dynamic precipitates can be attributed to microstructural difference and solubility limit of Al at different temperatures. By summarizing the tensile test results, the sample forged at 350 °C exhibited the best strength–ductility synergy, exhibiting the highest elongation (EL) of 23.2% with a 251 MPa yield strength (YS) and 394 MPa ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in center region, and combined with the highest strength value of 256 MPa YS and 420 MPa UTS in the center region, while the EL was slightly degraded to 19.8%. © 2023","Gradient microstructure; Magnesium alloy; Radial forging; Strengthening mechanism; Strength–ductility synergy","Cost engineering; Ductility; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Magnesium alloys; Microstructure; Piles; Technology transfer; Temperature; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Alloy bars; Band formations; Deformation band; Deformation temperatures; Gradient microstructure; High-strength; Radial forging; Strength-ductility synergies; Strengthening mechanisms; Ultimate tensile strength; Chemical activation","","","L.

YGJ decoction is originally prescribed in Qing Dynasty (1636 CE ∼ 1912 CE) in China, and is commonly used to treat liver diseases. There remain abundant literature investigating YGJ decoction from multiple aspects, but few reviews summarized the research and gave a precise definition, which impedes further applications and commercialization of YGJ decoction. Aim of the review: The aim of this review is to provide comprehensive descriptions of YGJ decoction, tackling with issues in the research and development of YGJ decoction. Materials and methods: The literature and clinical reports were obtained from the databases including Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science Periodical Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and SinoMed since 2000. The phytochemical characteristics, quality control, pharmaceutical forms, clinical position, pharmacological effects, and toxic events of YGJ decoction were included for analysis. Result: This review firstly summarized the progress of the chemical existences of YGJ decoction and discussed the advanced methods in monitoring quality of YGJ decoction and its herbal ingredients, particularly in the form of granules. Whilst this review aims to identify the pharmacological actions and clinical impacts of YGJ decoction, the medicinal materials that could provide these benefits were observed in the remaining herbs to exert the anti-fibrotic effects, anti-inflammatory activities, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic effects, and to universally treat liver and gastric diseases. This review provided supplementary descriptions on the safety issues, especially in Glehniae Radix and Toosendan Fructus, to define the alterations between hepatoprotective activities and unclear toxics in YGJ decoction application. Conclusions: Our comprehensively organized review discussed the chemical characteristics and the research in altering or identifying these essences. The effects of YGJ decoction on the non-clinical and clinical tests exert the good management of sophisticated diseases. In this review, current issues are discussed to inform and inspire subsequent research of YGJ decoction and other classical prescriptions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Chinese medicine; Classical prescription; Clinical application; Herbal medicine; Quality control; Yiguan Jian","Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Phytochemicals; Quality Control; herbaceous agent; phytochemical; Rehmannia; yiguan; Angelica sinensis; antidiabetic activity; antifibrotic activity; antiinflammatory activity; atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry; chemometric analysis; China; Chinese medicine; clinical outcome; clinical practice; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug safety; electrospray; herbal medicine; high performance thin layer chromatography; human; hydrophilic interaction chromatography; immunoregulation; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; light scattering; lipid peroxidation; liquid chromatography; Lycium barbarum; Medline; mitochondrial membrane potential; nonhuman; phytochemistry; prescription; quality control; regulatory T lymphocyte; Rehmannia; Rehmannia glutinosa; Review; ScienceDirect; search engine; signal transduction; thin layer chromatography; time of flight mass spectrometry; Web of Science; quality control","","","Z.

These issues are particularly common among people living with communication difficulties who are seeking care from speech and language therapists (SLTs). As such, the SLT must be aware of and sensitive to health literacy needs within their clinical practice, proactively adapting materials and resources to the health literacy needs of their patients. Despite this required core competency, little is known about the health literacy interventions used by SLTs when working with adult patients, and as such, there is limited and unclear guidance for the practicing clinician, leading to potentially suboptimal care delivery. Objectives: To explore the characteristics of health literacy interventions discussed in the literature for use by SLTs with adult patients. Search Strategy: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. Conference proceedings of the annual scientific meetings of the European Society for Swallowing Disorders and the Dysphagia Research Society were also searched. Grey literature was searched via the Open Grey database and, hand-searches of reference lists from included studies were conducted by both authors. Inclusion Criteria: Published and unpublished research investigating health literacy interventions provided by qualified SLTs providing care to adult patients in any setting for any speech and language related concerns. No language, geographic, study design or publication date limitations applied. Eligible participants in these studies were classified as: (1) patients and (2) professionals. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were charted in accordance with guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute and the PRISMA ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) independently by both authors. Main Results: A total of 1112 potentially eligible studies were identified in the initial search, with 15 studies ultimately included in the synthesis. Study design and quality varied significantly. Most explored basic functional health literacy or narratively described core components of health literacy, which an SLT should understand, without employing an investigative research design. Discussion: Limited research has been conducted on the use of health literacy interventions within adult speech and language therapy practices. This finding is significant as SLTs regularly work with people living with communication problems, and therefore, addressing health literacy should be a core tenet of service delivery. Conclusion: There is a need for valid, reliable and rigorous investigations of health literacy interventions within speech and language therapy to ultimately improve future patient access to and benefit from the care provided. Patient or Public Contribution: Patient public involvement in review studies is an emerging area. Due to resource issues, it was not possible to include this element in this study. © 2023 The Authors.

For thousands of years, it has been utilized for renal yang deficiency, impotence, spermatorrhea, impotence, weakness of tendons and bones, rheumatic paralysis and discomfort, numbness, and constriction. Aim of the study: The paper aims to comprehensively in-depth, and methodically review the most recent research on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicity of E. koreanum. Materials and methods: Scientific databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier, Springer, ScienceDirect, Baidu Scholar, and CNKI and medicine books in China were searched for relevant information on E. koreanum. Results: In traditional uses, E. koreanum is frequently used to treat various diseases like erectile dysfunction, infertility, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, asthma, kidney-yang deficiency syndrome, etc. To date, more than 379 compounds have been discovered from various parts of E. koreanum, including flavonoids, lignans, organic acids, terpenoids, hydrocarbons, dihydrophenanthrene derivatives, alkaloids, and others. Research has revealed that the compounds and crude extracts have a wide range of pharmacological effects on the reproductive, cardiovascular, and nervous systems, as well as anti-osteoporosis, anti-tumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective, and antiviral properties. Besides, the crude extracts show potential hepatotoxicity. Conclusion: Based on recent domestic and international research investigations, E. koreanum contains a wealth of chemical components with pronounced pharmacological activities. Its traditional uses are numerous, and the majority of these traditional uses have been supported by contemporary pharmacological investigations.

I explore main two main questions: Why was Reagan able to succeed when Nixon had failed? and What does the dismantling of the agency reveal about the development of American conservatism in the 1970s and 1980s? Drawing on original archival materials, I argue that the Reagan administration learned from Nixon's failures and adopted a more professional, managerial stance when it dismantled the agency in 1981. In addition, recent work in history and political science has explored how the multiracial democratic vision articulated by LBJ's Great Society helped fuel the modern conservative movement. By focusing on the long-term opposition against OEO/CSA, this article provides new insights into how conservatives articulated an alternative ideology to postwar liberalism. © Donald Critchlow and Cambridge University Press 2023.

However, existing metasurface-based illusion and cloaking devices are valid for the incident wave with a specific frequency, angle, or polarization, or exhibit a single function. Therefore, a terahertz tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) metasurface carpet cloak is proposed for dynamic illusion and cloaking. Simulation results show that by controlling the state of the VO2, the metasurface carpet cloak can simultaneously achieve illusion and cloaking functions, working at 0.45 THz and 0.6 THz, and is effective for orthogonal circularly polarized waves with different incidence angles. That is the function, frequency, incident angle, and polarization of the metasurface carpet cloak are dynamically adjustable. Besides, the metasurface carpet cloak is robust to the incident angle and is capable of polarization angle stability. This work has potential value in the real-life application of metasurface-based illusion and cloaking devices. © 2023 The Authors","Electromagnetics; Materials science; Physics","","","","F.

In this study, we developed highly macroporous and flexible antibacterial chitosan-based cryogel through rapid cryopolymerization induced by ultraviolet exposure. This designed cryogel exhibited exceptional palladium adsorption capabilities within an acidic environment, demonstrating swift and efficient adsorption. Remarkably, the chitosan-based cryogel showed an impressive palladium adsorption capacity, reaching 184.93 mg g−1 as Langmuir isotherm model, thus highlighting its promising potential for palladium recovery. The adsorption efficiency and concentration examination was conducted using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer in the presence of multiple coexisting ions. Various factors and parameters, including pH, contact time, temperature, concentration, and selectivity, were investigated to assess the effectiveness of the biopolymeric cryogel in palladium adsorption. Additionally, the thermal stability of the developed cryogel was explored within the temperature range of 25-100˚C, revealing a commendable palladium adsorption capacity even at 100˚C. This finding underscores the material's potential for application under challenging conditions. The cryogel that was synthesized exhibits an extended shelf-life of up to six months and can be reused without any discernible alteration in its adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, the palladium adsorption capacity was evaluated in a real-world sample, demonstrating commendable adsorption capabilities. Remarkably, the biosorbent displayed a higher selectivity of 91% for palladium, even in the competing ions presence. In summary, biosorbent offers superior adsorption performance and remarkable stability, making it a valuable contribution to polymer chemistry and environmental science. Its potential for recovering precious metals from wastewater is indeed noteworthy. © 2023","Antibacterial; Cryogel; Flexible; Palladium; Ultraviolet illumination; Waste electronic materials","Adsorption; Biopolymers; Chitosan; Efficiency; Isotherms; Recovery; Thermodynamic stability; Adsorption capability; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption efficiency; Antibacterials; Cryogels; Electronics materials; Flexible; Palladium recovery; Ultraviolet illumination; Waste electronic material; Palladium","","","J.

Prescriptions of various herbs in traditional East Asian medicine (TEAM) have recently gained attention among patients as a complementary alternative therapy for female infertility. However, studies on systemic analysis of the use of herbal medicines according to TEAM patterns or the therapeutic effects of herbal medicines on female infertility are limited. Aim of the study: We aimed to systematically investigate the single herb and TEAM patterns that are commonly used for treating female infertility using network analysis. Additionally, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the effect of herbal medicine on the pregnancy rate in women with infertility. Materials and methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Korean Studies Information Service System, Science ON, Research Information Sharing Service, and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the pregnancy rate of herbal medicine for infertility until July 2021. Following identifying the top three herbs used in treating female infertility, a network analysis was performed to reveal the TEAM pattern relationships between each herb. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of herbal medicine on pregnancy rate. Moreover, the methodological quality of RCTs was analyzed using Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension guidelines and the Risk of bias (RoB) tool. Results: Eighteen RCTs with 2,662 participants were included. Cuscuta chinensis Lam. (Tusizi) is the most commonly used herb for treating female infertility, followed by Angelica gigas Nakai (Danggui) and Cyperus rotundus L. (Xiangfuzi). These herbs were mainly used to treat patients with kidney deficiency or kidney deficiency combined with blood stasis or Phlegm-dampness on the TEAM pattern. The meta-analysis revealed that the effect of herbal medicine led to a significant increase in pregnancy rates compared to the placebo treatment. Adverse events in the included studies were generally mild and infrequent. The methodological quality of RCTs using CONSORT extension was poor, while the RoB of the included RCTs was generally low. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest that herbal medicine will be beneficial for treating female infertility by improving pregnancy rates. However, more carefully designed studies on herbal medicines are encouraged to improve the quality of herbal medicine research in the future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Female infertility; Herbal medicine; Korean medicine; Meta-analysis; Pregnancy rate; Systematic review; Traditional East Asian medicine","Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Infertility, Female; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Pregnancy; herbaceous agent; adult; Embase; female; female infertility; herbal medicine; human; information service; Medline; meta analysis; network analysis; pregnancy rate; quality control; research; Review; systematic review; therapy effect; female infertility; herbal medicine; medicinal plant; phytotherapy; pregnancy","","","J.-Y.

Efficient and reliable solutions are of great interest due to the promising reduction of labor-intensive calculations through data-driven prediction of target properties. One of the modern problems directly related to this topic is the enhancement of phase stability of functional materials with the required properties. In this work, we address the effects of Cd and Zn substitutions on the Pb sites on the structural stability of inorganic lead halide perovskite CsPbI3 — a semiconductor promising for optoelectronic devices. At room temperature, this material undergoes an undesirable phase transition from the direct band gap “black” to indirect “yellow” (ca. 15 meV/atom more favored) phase. For evaluations of effects caused by the substitutions, we combined the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and graph neural network (GNN) models. At low Cd and Zn contents, complete composition/configuration spaces comprising ca. 200 structures were set and studied using DFT. The GNN models trained on this data were used to predict energetics of ca. 74k structures with higher contents of substitutions and evaluate the energy differences between the phases. Because of the small amount of DFT data, an impact of data subsampling on the quality of predictions was comprehensively studied. Additionally, transfer learning routines were tested using available collections of DFT-derived properties. For the examined models, the root-mean-square errors of ca. 0.7 meV/atom were achieved in predicting formation energies. The data treatment workflows proposed and tested in this study open up perspectives for data-driven research of disordered materials of particular interest with low computational costs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Composition space; Configuration space; Data science; Deep learning; Defects in solids; Doped materials; Lead halide perovskite; Materials for optoelectronics","Computation theory; Crystal structure; Deep learning; Energy gap; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Lead compounds; Mean square error; Optoelectronic devices; Perovskite; Stability; Structural optimization; Structural properties; Composition space; Configuration space; Deep learning; Defects in solids; Density-functional-theory; Doped materials; Graph neural networks; Halide perovskites; Lead halide perovskite; Material for optoelectronic; Density functional theory","","","R.A.

Achieving atomic-thick precision in microscopic patterning is crucial to manipulating the functionalities and interfacial interactions of the 2D heterostructures. In this study, a silicon atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip was utilized to rub the surface of graphene (Gr)/MoS2 heterostructure and manipulate its physical properties. The contact force between the AFM tip and Gr/MoS2 surface was adjusted between 110 and 660 nN. Before rubbing, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of MoS2 was quenched due to the presence of Gr. After rubbing, the optical image and Raman spectroscopy acquired from the Gr/MoS2 heterostructure indicated that Gr started to be exfoliated by a contact force exceeding 220 nN. The absence of Gr due to exfoliation led to the restoration of MoS2′s pristine PL intensity. For demonstration, the AFM tip was used to exfoliate a designed micro-area covered with Gr using a 660 nN force, forming a patterned PL of MoS2. This technique enabled the creation of different structures to develop unique multilayer 2D material devices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Atomic force microscopy; Surface exfoliation; Two-dimensional heterostructure; Two-dimensional materials","Exfoliation (materials science); Geometrical optics; Molybdenum compounds; Nanoprobes; Photoluminescence; Atomic force microscopy tips; Atomic-force-microscopy; Contact forces; Contact mode atomic force microscopy; Photoluminescence intensities; Single layer; Surface exfoliation; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional heterostructure; Two-dimensional materials; Layered semiconductors","","","H.-C.

However, there are few studies on the anti-influenza mechanism of AG, and the mechanism of action is still unclear. Aim of the study: The purpose is to provide the latest information about the clinical efficacy, pharmacodynamic composition and mechanism of AG based on scientific literature, so as to enhance the utilization of AG in the treatment of influenza and related diseases, and promote the development and innovation of novel anti-influenza drugs targeting the influenza virus. Materials and methods: Enter the data retrieval room, search for Antiviral Granules, as well as the scientific names, common names, and Chinese names of each Chinese medicine. Additionally, search for the relevant clinical applications, pharmacodynamic composition, pharmacological action, and molecular mechanism of both Antiviral Granules and single-ingredient medicines. Keywords includes terms such as “antiviral granules”, “influenza”, “Isatis indigotica Fort.”, “Radix Isatidis”, “Banlangeng”, “pharmacology”, “clinical application”, “pharmacologic action”, etc. and their combinations. Obtain results from the Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Sci Finder Scholar, CNKI and other resources. Results: AG is effective in the treatment of influenza and is often used in combination with other drugs to treat viral diseases. Its chemical composition is complex, including alkaloids, polysaccharides, volatile oils, steroid saponins, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and other compounds. These compounds have a variety of pharmacological activities, which can interfere with the replication cycle of the influenza virus, regulate RIG-I-MAVS, JAK/STAT, TLRs/MyD88, NF-κB signaling pathways and related cytokines, regulate intestinal microorganisms, and protect both the lungs and extrapulmonary organs. Conclusions: AG can overcome the limitations of traditional antiviral drug therapy, play a synergistic role in fighting influenza virus with the characteristics of multi-component, multi-pathway and multi-target therapy, and reverse the bodily function damage caused by influenza virus. AG may be a potential drug in the prevention and treatment of influenza and related diseases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Antiviral granules; Clinical evidence; Influenza; Potential mechanisms; Traditional Chinese medicine","Antiviral Agents; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Plant Extracts; Treatment Outcome; antivirus agent; herbaceous agent; plant extract; Rehmannia; chemistry; Chinese medicine; treatment outcome","","","H.-Z.

The growing interest in these compounds is due to their combined hard–soft donor abilities, versatile coordination behavior, and presence of a variety of donor moieties like N, O, S, P, etc., depends upon ligand precursors and many other factors that provide plenty of rooms for the researchers in synthetic as well as application section. Lanthanide-based macrocyclic complexes are acquiring much focus from researchers because of their interesting chemical, magnetic, physical, and optical properties. These can be synthesized by the template or non-template synthesis method and used in diverse areas such as industrial, biological, catalytic, nanoscience, photocatalytic, and pharmaceutical are a few of them. These metal-based complexes can function as MRI contrast-enhancing agents, NMR shift reagents, chiral or non-chiral filter catalysts, conjugate antibodies, radio-immunotherapy, manmade cell organelle, fluorescent sensors, receptors, luminescence quenchers, medical imaging, and bioassays, etc. because of their strong and highly efficient interaction of the metal and ligand. Due to lanthanide contraction, with increasing atomic number of lanthanide(III) there is a steady decrease in ionic radius, which results in steric effects and regulates various properties like acidity, basicity, geometries, reactivity, selectivity, and stability of complexes of these metal ions. This review briefly describes the designing and synthesis of potentially important lanthanide-based macrocyclic complexes and their potent applications in diverse fields. We believe that this review leads to the development of metal–ligand chemistry with its tremendous varieties and will be fruitful for researchers working in this field. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Biological activity; Catalytic activity; Lanthanide metals; Macrocyclic complexes; Photoluminescence","Alkalinity; Atoms; Bioactivity; Ligands; Metal ions; Nanoscience; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Optical properties; Rare earth elements; Stereochemistry; Synthesis (chemical); 'current; Antifungals; Co-ordination chemistries; Lanthanide metal; Macrocyclic complex; Macrocyclics; Material science; Pharmaceutical science; Property; Prospectives; Catalyst activity","","","S.

Two-dimensional MXenes exhibit high structural stability and excellent electrical conductivity, and can be applied as electrode materials. Mechanical exfoliation can be facilitated by modifying the vacancy in the V2AlC MAX phase, which makes etching challenging. We report the effects of M (vanadium), A (aluminum), and X (carbon) vacancies on the mechanical behavior of V2AlC via ab initio calculations. To this end, the anisotropic mechanical properties and strain–stress curves were calculated for MAX phases with different vacancies (x = 0.08, which corresponds to 8.33 at.%). The presence of vanadium vacancies significantly deteriorated the structural and mechanical properties compared to those of aluminum and carbon vacancies. Thus, it was confirmed that vanadium vacancies had a significant effect on the mechanical exfoliation of the MAX phases. These findings provide further insights into the design of MXenes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Ceramics; Computer simulations; Energy storage materials; Vacancy formation","Aluminum; Aluminum compounds; Carbon; Etching; Exfoliation (materials science); Stability; Strain; Ab initio calculations; Carbon vacancy; Ceramic; Energy storage materials; Exfoliation process; MAX-phase; Mechanical exfoliation; Structural stabilities; Two-dimensional; Vacancy formation; Vanadium","","","J.

The meta-analysis revealed that the main active ingredients of AM lowered the levels of known risk factors including liver index (SMD, −1.25; 95% CI, −1.63 to −0.87; P < 0.00001), degree of liver fibrosis (SMD, −1.93; 95% CI, −2.57 to −1.28; P < 0.00001), collagen α type I (Col)-1 (SMD, −3.71; 95% CI, −5.63 to −1.79; P = 0.0001), hyaluronic acid (HA) (SMD, −2.65; 95% CI, −3.69 to −1.61; P < 0.00001), laminin (LN) (SMD, −2.06; 95% CI, −2.51 to −1.61; P < 0.00001), type IV collagen (CIV) (SMD, −3.04; 95% CI, −4.34 to −1.74; P < 0.00001), procollagen typeIII (PCIII) (SMD, −2.60; 95% CI, −3.15 to −2.05; P < 0.00001), albumin (ALB) (SMD, −1.19; 95% CI, −1.63 to −0.75; P < 0.00001), total bilirubin (TBiL) (SMD, −3.63; 95% CI, −5.39 to −1.88; P < 0.0001), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (SMD, −5.27; 95% CI, −6.94 to −3.61; P < 0.00001) and Smad3 (SMD, −4.11; 95% CI, −7.17 to −1.05; P = 0.009) level. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis demonstrates the effective role of the main active ingredients of AM in preclinical studies of liver fibrosis. The underlying mechanisms may be related to attenuation of oxidative stress, modulation of inflammatory response and inhibition of collagen production. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and poor quality of included studies, positive findings should be treated cautiously.

It is the smallest component unit of Chinese medicine prescription and an essential bridge between Chinese medicine and prescription. Curcumae Rhizoma (called Ezhu in Chinese) is a representative TCM herb that promotes blood circulation and removes blood stasis. It has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Ezhu is generally used in clinical applications as a part of a “drug pair” to treat heartburn, stomach pain, tumour, amenorrhea and abdominal pain caused by blood stasis, qi stagnation and injury. Aims of the review: This review aims to summarize the latest and comprehensive situation of the biological activity and clinical application of drug pairs containing Ezhu, find the law of Ezhu compatibility application, and discuss the rationalization of Ezhu drug compatibility. For Ezhu, herb pairs to provide a theoretical basis for clinical research in TCM and serve as a research foundation for developing new drugs. Materials and methods: Using a self-built prescription database and Apriori algorithm for association rule mining. A systematic search for studies on herb pairs containing Ezhu was carried out by using the internet databases of PubMed, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar and Web of Science, as well as other relevant textbooks, reviews and documents (e.g. Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2020 edition, Chinese herbal classic books and PhD and MSc theses, etc.). Among them with keywords including “Curcumae Rhizoma”, “Ezhu”, “herb pairs”, “clinical application”, etc. and their combinations. Moreover, the t-copula function was used to analyse the dose-coupling effect of five drug pairs, including Ezhu. Results: The preliminary statistical analysis retrieved Ezhu prescriptions from self-built prescription database and internet databases. The results showed that the compatibility frequency of Ezhu with the other five Chinese medicines was high. Most of these selected herbal combinations are used to treat internal diseases. In this paper, the progress of the ethnopharmacology of Ezhu was reviewed, emphasizing the changes in bioactive components and compatibility of Chinese traditional medicine combinations such as Ezhu and Astragalus Curcuma (Sparganium stoloniferum Buch. -Ham; called Sanleng in Chinese), Ezhu and Astragali Radix (Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao, Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge.; called Huangqi in Chinese). Some other varieties, such as Ezhu and Rhizoma Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort.; called Chuanxiong in Chinese), Trionycis Carapax (Trionyx sinensis Wiegmann; called Biejia in Chinese), and Coptidis Rhizoma (Coptis chinensis Franch., Coptis deltoidea C. Y. Cheng et Hsiao, Coptis teeta Wall.; called Huanglian in Chinese), are also recorded in ancient books but rarely researched. The dose of Ezhu is strongly correlated with the amount of Sanleng, Huangqi, Biejia, Chuanxiong and Huanglian, respectively. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between them. Conclusions: The bioactive components and compatibility effects of Ezhu herb pairs were studied in detail using data mining and t-copula function analysis. Ezhu and Astragalus Curcuma (Sanleng) mainly treat gynecological disorders by activating blood circulation and relieving congestion. Ezhu and Astragali Radix (Huangqi) drug pair and Ezhu and Trionycis Carapax (Biejia) drug pair are all commonly used in the clinical treatment of tumors, the former is mainly used clinically for the treatment of digestive tract-related inflammation and tumors, liver cancer and gynecological tumors, and the latter is commonly used for the treatment of malignant tumors, such as liver cancer and mammary cancer. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Compatibility; Curcumae Rhizoma; Ethnopharmacology; Herb pairs; T-copula function","Coptis; Coptis deltoidea; Female; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Plant Roots; Rhizome; Astragalus membranaceus extract; Coptis chinensis extract; ezhu; herbaceous agent; Ligusticum chuanxiong extract; plant extract; Sparganium stoloniferum extract; Trionyx sinensis extract; unclassified drug; Apriori algorithm; Astragalus membranaceus; breast cancer; Chinese medicine; Coptis chinensis; Coptis deltoidea; Curcuma; digestive system inflammation; digestive system tumor; ethnopharmacology; gynecologic disease; hemostasis; human; ischemia; Ligusticum sinense; liver cancer; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; Pelodiscus sinensis; prescription; Review; Sparganium; Sparganium stoloniferum; Coptis; female; liver tumor; plant root; rhizome","","","W.

Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a bioactive chalcone compound isolated from licorice. It has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its excellent anti-inflammatory activity. Aim of the study: This study is to provide a comprehensive summary of the anti-inflammatory activity of ISL and the underlying molecular mechanisms, and discuss new insights for its potential clinical applications as an anti-inflammation agent. Materials and methods: We examined literatures published in the past twenty years from PubMed, Research Gate, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and SciFinder, with single or combined key words of “isoliquiritigenin”, “inflammation”, and “anti-inflammatory”. Results: ISL elicits its anti-inflammatory activity by mediating various cellular processes. It inhibits the upstream of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and activates the nuclear factor erythroid related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. In addition, it suppresses the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) pathway and restrains the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Conclusions: Current studies indicate a great therapeutical potential of ISL as a drug candidate for treatment of inflammation-associated diseases.

Due to the extensive applications of nanographene sheets in various industries such as aerospace industry, fracture analysis of square nanographene sheets is of crucial importance. Stochastic analysis is widely applied in fracture mechanics because it helps the results to be more realistic. In the present work, probabilistic fracture analysis of nanographene sheets is done using scaled boundary finite element (SBFEM) that is a novel semi-analytical method. In order to apply the stochastic method, we need to select certain statistical parameters, the ones considered here include crack length and failure stress. The results using the stochastic response method are compared with those of the Monte Carlo, which shows good agreement. Average, variance, third and fourth moments of stress and the fracture probability are calculated for all the bonds in two states of crack angle 0°, 90°. The results indicate that the maximum crack-tip fracture probability for central crack θ = 90° is 95%, while for θ = 0° equals 58%. For central crack θ = 90°, the failure probability in crack tip bonds, bonds adjacent to the crack edge and other bonds equal 95%, 88% and 65%, respectively. For nanographene sheet having the central crack θ = 90°, probabilistic density function is Gaussian, which reaches the highest point at the displacement being 0.990 pm. The third moment of the stress turned out to be zero, which shows that the input uncertain variables are all normal. The results obtained from computing the failure probability of all the bonds indicates that the highest failure probability is in the tip and edges of the crack. The stochastic fracture sensitivity versus crack length is calculated which shows that the maximum sensitivity in central crack happens when θ = 90° and crack length ranges between 0.3 and 0.4. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","Crack; Monte Carlo method; Nanographene; Stochastic response analysis","Aerospace industry; Crack propagation; Finite element method; Monte Carlo methods; Stochastic systems; Central cracks; Crack length; Failure Probability; Fracture analysis; Fracture probability; MonteCarlo methods; Nanographene; Response analysis; Stochastic response; Stochastic response analyse; Crack tips","","","M.

Hawthorn is recognized as an edible medicinal plant with applications related to strengthening the digestive system, promoting blood circulation, and resolving blood stasis. Aim of the review: This study critically summarized the traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties to provide a theoretical basis for further studies on hawthorn and its applications in medicine and food. Materials and methods: The available information on hawthorn was gathered from scientific databases (including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Baidu Scholar, CNKI, online ethnobotanical databases, and ethnobotanical monographs, and considered data from 1952 to 2023). Information about traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and safety concerns of the collected data is comprehensively summarized in this paper. Results: The literature review revealed that hawthorn includes more than 1000 species primarily distributed in the northern temperate zone. Traditional uses of hawthorn have lasted for millennia in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Within the past decade, 337 chemical compounds, including flavonoids, lignans, fatty acids and organic acids, monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, terpenoids and steroids, have been identified from hawthorn. Modern pharmacological studies have confirmed numerous bioactivities, such as cardiovascular system influence, antitumor activity, hepatoprotective activity, antimicrobial properties, immunomodulatory functions, and anti-inflammatory activities. Additionally, evaluations have indicated that hawthorn lacks toxicity. Conclusions: Based on its traditional uses, chemical composition, and pharmacological studies, hawthorn has significant potential as a medicinal and edible plant with a diverse range of pharmacological activities. Traditional uses of the hawthorn include the treatment of indigestion, dysmenorrhea, and osteoporosis. However, modern pharmacological research primarily focuses on its cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system effects, antitumor effects, and liver protection properties. Currently, there is a lack of correlative research involving its traditional uses and pharmacological activities. Moreover, phytochemical and pharmacological research has yet to focus on many types of hawthorn with traditional applications.

(PO), popularly known as purslane, has been documented in ethnopharmacology in various countries and regions. Traditional application records indicated that PO might be used extensively to treat the common cold, dysentery, urinary tract infections, coughing, eye infections, skin problems, gynecological diseases, and pediatric illnesses. Aim of the review: This paper includes a systematic review of the traditional usage, phytochemicals, pharmacological activity, and potential uses of PO to provide an overview of the research for further exploitation of PO resources. Materials and methods: This article uses “Portulaca oleracea L.” and “purslane” as the keywords and collects relevant information on PO from different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Science Direct, ACS, Wiley, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, and ancient meteria medica. Results: PO is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is grown worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that purslane has the effect of improving eyesight, eliminating evil qi, quenching thirst, purgation, diuresis, hemostasis, regulating qi, promoting hair growth, detoxifying, and avoiding epidemic qi. Recent phytochemical investigations have shown that PO is a rich source of flavonoids, homoisoflavonoids, alkaloids, organic acids, esters, lignans, terpenoids, catecholamines, sterols, and cerebrosides. The purslane extracts or compounds have exhibited numerous biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, renoprotective, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, metabolic, muscle relaxant, anti-asthmatic and anti-osteoporosis properties. The significant omega-3 fatty acids, vital amino acids, minerals, and vitamins found in purslane also provide nutritional benefits. Purslane as a food/feed additive in the food industry and animal husbandry has caused concern. Its global wide distribution and tolerance to abiotic stress characteristics make it in the future sustainable development of agriculture a certain position. Conclusions: Based on traditional usage, phytochemicals, and pharmacological activity, PO is a potential medicinal and edible plant with diverse pharmacological effects. Due to purslane's various advantages, it may have vast application potential in the food and pharmaceutical industries and animal husbandry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Content; Ethnopharmacology; Food industry; Pharmacology; Phytochemistry; Purslane","Animals; Child; Ethnopharmacology; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Phytochemicals; Plant Extracts; Portulaca; alkaloid derivative; carboxylic acid; catecholamine derivative; cerebroside; ester derivative; flavonoid; herbaceous agent; lignan derivative; polysaccharide; sterol derivative; terpenoid derivative; phytochemical; plant extract; animal husbandry; antiinflammatory activity; antimicrobial activity; antineoplastic activity; antiosteoporotic activity; antioxidant activity; biological activity; Chinese medicine; drug effect; drug research; drug safety; drug structure; ethnopharmacology; food industry; human; immunomodulation; intestine flora; liver protection; muscle relaxant effect; neuroprotection; nonhuman; nutritional value; pharmacological science; phytochemistry; Portulaca oleracea; renal protection; Review; stomach protection; sustainable development; animal; chemistry; child; ethnopharmacology; Portulaca","","","H.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of skin substitutes, biomaterials, and topical agents with standard care. Recent Advances: A meta-analysis was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EM-BASE, and Web of Science were searched using the following keywords diabetes mellitus AND skin graft OR tissue replacement OR dressing OR drug. Two independent reviewers performed data collection and quality assessment of the eligible studies. The primary outcome was the 12- to 16-week healing rates and the secondary outcome was recurrence rates. Critical Issues: Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials, including 3,862 patients, were analyzed. The studies exhibited low heterogeneity (s2 = 0.10) without significant asymmetry (Egger’s test, p = 0.8852). After pooling direct and indirect estimates, placenta-based tissue products exhibited the best wound healing probability (p-score = 0.90), followed by skin substitutes with living cells (p-score = 0.70), acellular skin substitutes (p-score = 0.56), and advanced topical dressings (p-score = 0.34) compared with standard of care. The recurrence analysis showed significant improvement in the intervention group compared with the control group (11.21% vs. 15.15%). Future Directions: This network meta-analysis provides the relative effectiveness and rank of biomaterials and topical dressings in DFU healing. The results could help clinical decision making.

Acting as a post-processing tool for a density-functional perturbation theory code (Quantum ESPRESSO) and WANNIER90, EPIq exploits the localization of the deformation potential in the Wannier function basis and the stationary properties of a force-constant functional with respect to the first-order perturbation of the electronic charge density to calculate many electron-phonon related properties with high accuracy and free from convergence issues related to Brillouin zone sampling. EPIq features include: the adiabatic and non-adiabatic phonon dispersion, superconducting properties (including the superconducting band gap in the Migdal-Eliashberg formulation), double-resonant Raman spectra and lifetime of excited carriers. The possibility to customize most of its input makes EPIq a versatile and interoperable tool. Particularly relevant is the interaction with the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA) allowing anharmonic effects to be included in the calculation of electron-properties. The scalability offered by the Wannier representation combined with a straightforward workflow and easy-to-read input and output files make EPIq accessible to the wide condensed matter and material science communities. Program summary: Program Title: EPIq CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/f2syws66d7.1 Developer's repository link: https://gitlab.com/the-epiq-team/epiq Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: FORTRAN95 External routines: BLAS (http://www/netlib.org/blas), LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack), Quantum ESPRESSO (https://www.quantum-espresso.org/), wannier90 (https://wannier.org/) Nature of problem: Direct first principles calculation of quantities obtained via linear response methods in solid-state systems, such as the deformation potential, can be computationally demanding, hindering proper convergence. Solution method: An interpolation scheme exploiting the localization of the deformation potential in the Wannier function basis and the stationary properties of a force-constant functional with respect to the first-order perturbation of the electronic charge density is implemented in EPIq.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the status and trend of the research on them, this study conducted a quantitative and visual analysis of 6296 relevant publications obtained from Web of Science between 1994 and 2022 using CiteSpace software. By using the bibliometric method, this work systematically analyzed the knowledge structure, research hotspots and trends of ZVI-based materials in this field. The results show that the research on ZVI-based materials in this field developed rapidly over the past 28 years. China is the greatest contributor with the most published articles and collaborations. Still, the USA has the most academic influence with the highest average citations per article. Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tongji University are the primary establishments that produced the greatest number of publications and had the highest h-index. Keyword cluster analysis indicates that the primary research topics are related to reductive dechlorination, sulfate radical, arsenic removal, graphene oxide, porous media, peroxymonosulfate, groundwater remediation, and permeable reactive barrier. Meanwhile, keyword burst analysis reveals that the primary research hotspots and frontiers of ZVI focus on its modification, the refractory and emerging contaminants treatment, persulfate activation, and electron transfer. However, no keywords or topics related to the environmental impact and toxicity of ZVI-based materials are available in the keyword clustering and burst analysis results, indicating this direction deserves more attention in future research. Through a comprehensive and in-depth bibliometric analysis, this paper provides new insight into the research hotspots and development trends of the research on ZVI-based materials in environmental remediation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","CiteSpace; Environmental remediation; Knowledge mapping; Scientometric analysis; Zero-valent iron","China; United States; Activation analysis; Cluster analysis; Dechlorination; Free radical reactions; Graphene; Groundwater pollution; Iron; Pollution control; Porous materials; Sulfur compounds; arsenic; arsenic acid; arsenic trioxide; graphene oxide; ground water; iron nanoparticle; radical; sulfate; Citespace; Environmental remediation; Hotspots; Iron based materials; Knowledge mapping; Scientometric analysis; Visual analysis; Visualization analysis; Web of Science; Zero-valent iron; arsenic; cluster analysis; environmental impact; iron nanoparticle; toxicity; visual analysis; visualization; aqueous solution; betweenness centrality; citation analysis; cluster analysis; constructed wetland; controlled study; data visualization; dechlorination; dehalogenation; denitrification; ecosystem restoration; heavy metal removal; photocatalysis; physisorption; quantitative analysis; Review; scientometrics; urbanization; Web of Science; Groundwater","","","C.

The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method offers inherent benefits in dealing with complex interfaces and large material deformations in extreme mechanics problems. However, SPH simulations for 3D engineering applications are time-consuming. To address this issue, we introduce MPI (Message Passing Interface) in our SPH scheme to reduce computational time. Some optimizations are adopted to ensure the massive computation of the SPH method. In particular, an optimized memory management strategy is developed to control the memory footprint. With the present MPI-based massive parallelization of the SPH method, several validation examples are tested and analyzed. By comparing the present numerical results with the reference data, the dynamic failure process of complex structures subjected to extreme loadings like explosive and impact loadings can be well captured. A large number of particles, up to 2.04 billion, are adopted in the present simulations. The scaling tests show that the scalability of the massively parallel SPH program achieves a maximum parallel efficiency of 97% on 10020 CPU cores. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme mechanics problems; Massive high performance computing; Memory management; Message passing interface; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics","Failure (mechanical); Hydrodynamics; Software testing; Dynamic failures; Extreme mechanic problem; Failure process; Massive high performance computing; Memory-management; Message passing interface; Message-passing; Performance computing; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods; Message passing","","","M.

Clearing heat and resolving toxin (CHRT), one of most critical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapeutic principles, has been widely used in the treatment of PLC patients especially after TACE. However, there is no enough clinical evidence to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combined therapy. Aim of the study: To comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combined CHRT-CHF with TACE in the treatment of PLC. Materials and methods: 7 databases were searched from their inception until February 1, 2023. The primary outcomes included survival rate (1-, 2-year), objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR), liver function indicators (AST, ALT), adverse reactions including fever, upper digestive tract side and myelosuppression, AFP were selected as the secondary outcomes. RevMan5.4 software was used to evaluate the quality of included studies; meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, meta-regression analysis, publication bias and trial sequential analyses (TSA) was conducted by Stata software 12.0. Results: There were 40 RCTs involving 3649 patients. Patients treated with TACE plus CHRT-CHF showed significantly better 1-, 2-year survival (respectively: OR, 2.23 [1.67–2.97]; OR, 2.13 [1.56–2.92]), ORR (OR, 2.14 [1.82–2.52]), DCR (OR, 2.13 [1.73–2.62]) compared with TACE alone. There was a decreased incidence of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and postembolization syndrome (PES) in patients receiving the combined TACE with CHRT-CHF compared with TACE alone. Subgroup analysis found that lower proportion (20–30%) of CHRT-CHF significantly enhanced survival rate and DCR, higher proportion (≥40%) of CHRT-CHF reduced PES after TACE treatment. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of the combined CHRT-CHF with TACE were validated in this meta-analysis, the optimal proportion of CHRT-CHF in enhancing the efficacy may be 20–30%; Additionally, higher proportion (≥40%) of CHRT-CHF appears to reduce PES after TACE treatment. The potential role of combined relative proportion of CHRT-CHF with TACE should be emphasized in clinic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Clearing-heat and resolving-toxin; Efficacy; Primary liver cancer; TACE; TCM","alpha-Fetoproteins; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; Hot Temperature; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; alanine aminotransferase; alpha fetoprotein; antineoplastic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; bailian huapi; buqi quyu jiedu; carboplatin; chaishao liujunzi; Chinese medicinal formula; cisplatin; dahuang mudan; doxorubicin; epirubicin; fluorouracil; fuzheng huayu; fuzheng jiedu; gan ji; ganji; gemcitabine; jianpi jiedu; jianpi liqi; jianpi xiaozang; jiedu hugan; lianhua qing gan; loplatin; mitomycin; oxaliplatin; pirarubicin; qinggan huadu zhuyu; qinggan huayu; qingre jiedu; retetrasse; rougan huaxian jiedu; tegafur; unclassified drug; xiaoai huapi; xiaochaihu; xiaoliu; yanyin qingdu; yao yao quan ti; yexiazhu; yigan yiliu; yiqi huoxue kangai; yiqi yangyin; yiqitace huoxue kang ai; zhenggan huazheng; alpha fetoprotein; adult; advanced cancer; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alpha fetoprotein blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase level; bone marrow suppression; cancer control; cancer staging; cancer survival; chemoembolization; Chinese medicine; clearing heat and resolving toxin; clinical outcome; CNKI database; Cochrane Library; controlled study; disease control rate; drug efficacy; drug induced disease; drug safety; early cancer; Embase; female; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; human; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; liver pain; male; Medline; meta analysis; middle aged; nausea and vomiting; objective response rate; overall survival; postembolization syndrome; randomized controlled trial (topic); survival rate; survival time; syndrome; systematic review; treatment response; unspecified side effect; upper abdominal pain; upper gastrointestinal tract; WanFang Database; Web of Science; high temperature; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; treatment outcome","ftorafur","","S.
